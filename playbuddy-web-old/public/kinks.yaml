    This experience significantly boosted my self-esteem. Interestingly,
    our performances weren't always overtly sexual.
    On one occasion, we staged
    a fantasy featuring a queen and her loyal dragon, on a quest to locate her family
    cock ring.

    Captivating around 5,000 viewers simultaneously. This audience size
    surpasses that of a typical TED conference, with all eyes focused on us.
    to receiving such a volume of compliments regarding my appearance; terms like
    "hot," "beautiful," "nice ass," "nice dick," and "sexy" were just
    some of the accolades from numerous viewers. Previously, I often viewed myself
    as merely average, sometimes even unattractive. However, this experience provided
    undeniable affirmation that I am indeed attractive to a significant number of
    people, which was a monumental boost to my confidence.
