SUMMARY:Genderfuckery

DESCRIPTION:We express our genders (or lack thereof) in many ways. However\
 , it can feel dysphoric when our inner vision of our gender expression fee
 ls incongruous with our outer physical execution. This class is intended t
 o help you get in touch with your body\, and explore ways to bring your ph
 ysicality more in line with the way you want to express your gender. We wi
 ll be discussing how society’s expectations of gender expression play a 
 role in how one's physicality is perceived\, and how someone can use these
  often restrictive expectations to their advantage when trying to match th
 eir physicality to their gender presentation. This class is a combination 
 of discussion and accessible exercises\, and designed to be a safer space 
 to explore and have fun with your body and gender expression\n\nOrganizers

SUMMARY:WASTELAND Triangle Suspension
LOCATION:Dungeon Trees
DESCRIPTION:Explore dynamic movement with a minimalist and playful 'circus 
 bondage'-style 3- to 5- point rig. An example suspension transition sequen
 ce using this structure will be demonstrated\, as well as tips for flyers 
 on taking full advantage of the freedom & flow offered by this suspension.
  Potential flyer-driven shapes include running person\, splits\, pinwheel\
 , lotus\, birdcage\, pike\, and many more. Unleash your inner aerialist 
 – this is *not* traditional Shibari in any sense!\n\nThe first half of c
 lass is a lecture and demo. In the remaining time\, attendees with appropr
 iate suspension experience may try the rig and/or the sequence. During the
  hands-on time\, attendees will need to tie all required harnesses indepen
 dently.\n\nThis class is self- or partnered-suspension friendly. Anyone is
  welcome to observe. This is an advanced suspension class.\n\nTo participa
 te in the hands-on portion\, the pre-requisites are:\n- Tiers: This fast-m
 oving class is not appropriate for suspension bondage beginners. Tops shou
 ld know\, at minimum\, suspension-ready chest harness (arms-free preferred
 \, but arms-in may be used at the discretion of the tying pair)\, attachin
 g support lines\, and basics of negotiation and risk mitigation for suspen
 sion bondage.\n\n- Flyers: Body and health awareness to participate safely
  at a level appropriate for your body. Experience with suspension ties tha
 t heavily load the chest. \n\n- Self-suspenders: Same requirements as for 
 tiers AND flyers.\n\nSupplies: Your basic suspension kit. Synthetic/rated 
 rope for all uplines and locking carabiners are strongly recommended\; a m
 inimum of one piece of rated rope for the critical upline is required. Ins
 tructors will have POSH and AmSteel available for attendees to borrow if n
 eeded. Flyers should ideally wear snug leggings and firm-soled shoes that 
 can be tied over.\n\nOrganizers: Shay Tiziano\n\nThis is an unofficial aut

SUMMARY:The Binding Clue: Piecing Together Floor Scenes
LOCATION:Pavilion
DESCRIPTION:This class is designed for intermediate to advanced tying pairs
  who want to deepen their understanding of floorwork. We'll focus on const
 ructing intentional scenes using foundational elements like the single col
 umn tie\, hojo cuffs\, and frictions.\nFloor scenes can sometimes feel eit
 her too open-ended(confusing and out of control) or too scripted(awkward a
 nd clinical). In this class\, we’ll attempt to do the delicious secret t
 hird thing. You'll learn to treat each intention as a “clue\,” fitting
  pieces together with both technical proficiency and emotional presence. W
 hether you are interested in spontaneous improvisation or exploring iconic
  positions\, this class will touch upon mapping the arc of a floor scene. 
 \nExpect a short demo to set the tone\, followed by guided rope games that
  foster collaboration\, experimentation\, and playful investigation. \n\nR
 equirements : \n- People tying : solid single column tie\, hojo cuff\, at 
 least one friction\, and rope handling for floor work.\n\n- People being t
 ied : familiarity with assessing and communicating for body awareness and 
 safety in floor work.\n\nOrganizers: March\n\nThis is an unofficial automa

 ability to varying body types and abilities. The second half of the class

 e’ll work together to troubleshoot and find solutions for your unique ch
 allenges. This is a space for rope practitioners to deepen their skills wi
 th a body-aware\, flexible mindset—so we can build better bondage for ev
 ery body.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- The person tying should already be comforta
 ble with foundational tying techniques and be ready to adapt and troublesh
 oot their bondage for various bodies. This is not a beginner class and beg
 inner skills will not be covered.\n\n- The person being tied should be com
 fortable being in rope and able to give feedback about sensation\, comfort
 \, and physical limitations. While advanced rope experience isn’t requir
 ed\, a baseline familiarity with being tied—and a willingness to engage 
 in collaborative problem-solving—is essential. This class involves body-

SUMMARY:Kinetic Bondage: Contact Improvisation in Floor Rope
LOCATION:Dungeon (Class Tent)
DESCRIPTION:In this dynamic\, hands-on class\, we blend the principles of c
 ontact improvisation(a postmodern dance form) with rope\, creating a colla
 borative movement lab focused on connection\, responsiveness\, and flow. \
 nPeople tying will learn to convey tempo\, velocity\, levels\, and weight 
 with rope and touch. People being tied will learn to place their emotions 
 and affect into modalities of nonverbal communication to optimize connecti
 on. We'll investigate how power\, vulnerability\, and mutual curiosity can
  be communicated not just through fibers\, but through shared weight\, mov
 ement\, and touch.\nThe class begins with solo and partnered movement exer
 cises (without rope) to awaken somatic awareness and establish physical tr
 ust. Then we’ll transition to using rope as a medium\, emphasizing respo
 nsiveness over choreography\, and feeling over form. \nWhether you're tyin
 g or being tied\, you’ll gain tools for reading and shaping a scene with
  greater emotional clarity\, physical nuance\, and collaborative intention
 . \n\nRequirements:\n- People tying must know how to tie a non-cinching si
 ngle column tie with ease and speed.\n\n- People being tied should know ba
 sic nerve safety and be comfortable with verbal communication.\n\n- All pa
 rticipants should have some experience with floor rope and be open to move
 ment-based exploration. Participants will be instructed to walk\, stand\, 
 and sit on the ground - modifications are welcome and appreciated.\n\nOrga

 hard emotions that sometimes show up at the end of Camp and after - but to
  also encourage a sense of the tidal emotional Lift that we can ride to th
 e depths of our life\, outside of Camp.\nWouldn’t it be so fun to have a
  dance party where we Lift each other up\, and it sends us off to the outs
 ide world full of love\, encouragement and bliss? Campers often mention th
 at they didn't get a chance to wear all of the amazing outfits they brough
 t\, so we'll also have a brief fashion show before the dance party for fol
 ks to show off any clothes they didn’t get to wear during Camp. You don
 ’t have to be any good a CatWalking to be in the show\, just have a desi
 re to show off what you didn’t get a chance to wear\, or to give that ou
 tfit you wore and loved\, a TakeTwo!\n\nOrganizers: Redwood\n\nThis is an

 n
LOCATION:Barn Class Tent
DESCRIPTION:If you are interested in the intersection of pain\, spiritualit
 y\, and playing with sacrament\, this is the class for you! For centuries\
 , the Opus Dei sect of the Catholic Church has followed a tenant of corpor
 al mortification\; They use pain and discomfort as a way to find spiritual
  insight. As a result\, this sect has developed many tools and practices t
 hat shoehorn nicely into BDSM play. This class explores the history of Cor
 poral Mortification across multiple faiths and cultures\, discusses how on
 e can use pain and ordeal as both adrenaline pumping activities as well as
  meditative practices\, and will demonstrate several of the tools used for
  corporal mortification and how they can be used in scenes.\n\nOrganizers:

SUMMARY:WASTELAND Pallet Wrap Suspension
LOCATION:Dungeon Trees
DESCRIPTION:Pallet wrap is great for keeping the drawers from falling out o
 f your furniture as you are moving\, for keeping dozens of cases of potato
  chips on a pallet when they are loaded onto a truck\, and for suspending 
 a bottom with absolutely no rope whatsoever. We make sure that attendees u
 nderstand that we are not using saran wrap\, but instead an industry suppl
 y with a high tensile strength. This technique is ideal for just about any
 one\, including people for whom traditional rope suspensions might be diff
 icult or uncomfortable (due to weight\, odd centers of gravity\, and even 
 some circulation issues)\n\nOrganizers: Madeline\, Alex\n\nThis is an unof
