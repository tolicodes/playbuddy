    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Pain & Physicality\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\n**Pain & Physicality**\n\n*   **Power in Pain**: Understand the connection between power and pain, and how to use physicality to deepen your scenes.\n*   **Impact Techniques**: Learn various impact tools and techniques to create the desired level of intensity while maintaining control.\n*   **Physical Power Exchange**: Utilize your bodies in more ways to create relational power.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> POWER PLAY: Fall Series (Thursdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n> Pain & Physicality (Oct 10th)\n\n> Influence & Control (Oct 17th)\n\n> Resistance & Brat Taming (Oct 24th)",

The famously colorful, diverse, and inclusive party melds with HoY to pull out all the stops, with iconic performers bringing NRG to the most euphoric music. Prepare your body and soul for an epic night of ecstatic dance, expression, and spectacle.

Gravitating toward music at a young age, he started frequenting disco clubs in the mid ‘70s and quickly became an established DJ in the scene.\n\nAlthough he would go on to play at a variety of storied nightspots, including Studio 54, Paradise Garage and Electric Circus, Benitez truly made his mark with a residency at the Fun House in Manhattan, which he held from 1981 to 1984. During those years, his production and remix career also took off, as he reworked seminal tracks from Rockers Revenge, Jimmy Spicer and Afrika Bambaataa; two of his remixes from 1983’s _Flashdance_ soundtrack also became sizeable hits. Around the same time, he was enlisted by Madonna to contribute to her debut album, producing “Holiday” (her first hit) and remixing several other tracks.\n\nHe would later produce and remix countless other acts throughout the decade, including Whitney Houston, Hall & Oates, Sheena Easton, Talking Heads, Billy Joel, Fleetwood Mac, The Pointer Sisters, Debbie Harry, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney, to name just a few. Benitez also created music of his own, scoring hits with tracks like “Sidewalk Talk” (a song co-written by Madonna) and his cover of Babe Ruth’s “The Mexican” before releasing his debut album, _Just Visiting This Planet_, in 1987.\n\nHe remains active on the club scene today, and is largely regarded as one of the key figures who shepherded New York City nightlife out of the disco era, not to mention a pioneer of the [freestyle genre](https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/specials/freestyle-oral-history/).\n\n[**Ladymonix**](https://soundcloud.com/ladymonix)\n\nDetroit-based DJ / producer, responsible for some of the best club-nights the city has to offer. Ladymonix taps into deep, stripped-down, classic-house elements to create raw dancefloor magic.\n\n[**Boyyyish**](https://soundcloud.com/boyyyish)\n\nboyyyish blends his unique ethnic background into adiverse sound journey; his sets transcend genre boundaries in his sonic exploration and expertise behind the decks, and his successive sets for Christina Visca \\[Sound Factory/Paradise Garage\\] and Susanne Bartsch \\[Copacabana/Le Bain\\] has helped establish him among NYC nightlife legends and up-and-coming acts.\n\nHe has supported the likes of Danny Krivit, Todd Edwards, Eli Escobar, Rich Medina, Dimitri from Paris, Tedd Patterson, Hex Hector, JD Samson, Lauren Flax, Kim Anh, Dana Montana, and SG Lewis. He’s produced Club Boyyyish, a techno party spotlighting BIPOC and LGBTQ+ DJs, in an effort to amplify marginalized voices in nightlife. His collective, Love Prism, with Ty Sunderland has been a queer dance staple for the past 5 years throwing some of NY’s biggest Pride events at 3 Dollar Bill and Webster Hall. His weekly radio show “Breakfast with boyyyish” (Thursday mornings on the [House of Yes YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/HouseofYesNYC)) delves into deep cut 80s and 90s electronic music, exploring the origins of a variety of dance music genres across the world.\n\n**⫸ EXPERIENCES**\n\nExplore, engage, connect.

You danced like the night would never end, and suddenly, I didn’t want it to.\n\nIf you remember me (or even if you don’t), I’ll be back at Blood Night: Vampire Ball. You can find me on the dancefloor raving like a lunatic.

    "description": "Downtown Brooklyn Polyamory is back with another picnic in the park! Join us as we welcome our local non-monogamous, polyamorous, and curious folks for conversation and connection.\n\nAs usual, expect to chat about how to be our best poly/non-monogamous selves. This event is outdoors, and will mostly be about free mingling and chatting. Whether you are a long-time group member eager to reconnect with old friends, or a first-timer looking to learn more about polyamory and non-monogamy and meet like-minded people, come join us!\n\n**First-time attendees, please see one of the organizers when you arrive to get a welcome, a name-tag, and to be introduced to the group.** Organizers can be identified by the stars (badly) drawn on the four corners of their name-tags.\n\nWeather permitting, we will be in Brooklyn Bridge Park in the green space just South of Pier 1 (Bridge View Lawn) from 2:00pm - 4:30pm, but feel free to stay longer. This location is a grassy field with both shade and sun. It is always wise to bring something like a blanket, towel or little tarp to sit on in case the ground is wet. Feel free to bring snacks or drinks to share, but coming empty-handed is also totally fine. In case of heavy rain, we may reschedule at the last minute, but we usually proceed if there is only a drizzle or a short shower.\n\nThis meetup is about connecting with old and new friends and sharing ideas and experiences. It is not a cruising or pickup event, so please do not come with those expectations or intentions as they can make folks uncomfortable and feel unsafe. As always, be sure to get permission before getting close to or touching any other participant. Help us keep this a safe and supportive space!\n\nOur group values ethics, inclusion, growth and compassion as a means to support each of our unique journeys in developing non-traditional relationships. Please be prepared to bring those values, along with an awareness of the fundamental importance of consent and a respect for all others if you attend our events. We look forward to welcoming everyone interested or curious about non-monogamy and polyamory. :)\n\nSee you in the park!\n\nMarco, Faun, & Clara",

This special edition is open to the public.**\n\nHit Me Up afternoon social event featuring pop up market by [Charmskool](https://charmskoolshop.com/en-us), the UK’s favorite k\\*nk positive shopping destination. Get your hands on exclusive art & fashion from local & visiting international brands. Hello awesome Halloween outfits!\n\nFor our vetted members, this is a great chance to get to introduce yourself to the community and for us to get to know you so that we can invite you to our private events. If you're already a private member, our Hangouts are the perfect opportunity to make some new friends leading up to our upcoming private events.\n\nCome laugh, drink, and relax it off at the HMU loft with a crowd of new and old friends.\n\n**About the Event**\n\nJoin us as we welcome [Charmskool](https://charmskoolshop.com/en-us), the UK’s favourite Handmade K\\*nk Marketplace for their first **_ever_** stateside pop up market. Shop from 20+ local & international makers selling spicy fashion (lat3x, leather, lingerie), art & toys. We’ll also have some exciting activities throughout the day so look out for announcements! This event is part of a social at the expansive HMU loft, so expect drinks, tunes and chill vibes plus plenty of space to relax & meet new friends!\n\nWe are so excited to bring these incredible events together for one weekend of creative, inclusive spicy fun. Make sure you sign up for newsletters to stay in the know, **and** as a bonus, all ticket purchases come with a 15% off code to f3tish artisan website [Charmskoolshop.com](https://Charmskoolshop.com), as a welcome gift for their launch in North America!\n\n**I'm new, what are these like?** Our Hangout events are smaller and more intimate than our mixers, anywhere from 70 to 120 people usually show up. That means there are plenty of new folks to meet, and hopefully the right types for whatever you're into. Hangouts are only open to vetted members, which means a better awareness of our community standards than our public events.\n\nEverything is PG-13, and it's fairly easy to meet new folks—everyone who comes to these events is specifically looking to at least make new friends. So don't be shy, introduce yourself. And if you run into any problems or someone makes you uncomfortable, talk to a guardian with a red armband, and we'll take care of it.\n\n**Membership**: This event is open to the public. If you want to apply for our vetted membership to access our other events, you can go to [https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/join](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/join) and fill out an application.\n\nThere will be no tickets sold at the door, all attendees must purchase them in advance.\n\n**Dress code**: There's no enforced dress code, but we recommend all black or something nice. A bit of kinky flair is always welcome. If you look like you're going to try to pitch us on a totally fair fantasy football trade or the landlord hustle lifestyle, you'll probably have less fun.\n\n**Volunteers**: We are looking for volunteers to work the door and guardian at this event. To volunteer please reach out to admin@hitmeupnyc.com.\n\n**Consent Policy**: This is an ASK FIRST event and the rules of respectful and consensual behavior WILL be enforced. You will be responsible for reading the policy and behaving appropriately. Guardians will be present throughout the night. Please click here to read our consent policy in full. **Aggressive cruising or aggressively asking for private member sponsorship or approval will not be tolerated.** Take time and get to know the community!\n\n**Accessibility:** The venue is wheelchair accessible with an elevator and no stairs to the front door. If you have questions about the space please email hello@hitmeupnyc.com.\n\n**Covid Safety:** Please stay home if you are feeling ill or if you have had recent close contact with someone who tested Covid positive (within the past 5 days). You could be incubating and still test negative. Any requests for refunds for any reason will be honored up to the day of the party. Just email hello@hitmeupnyc.com and we will give you a full refund, no questions asked.\n\n\\---\n\n**ABOUT HIT ME UP**\n\n**What is Hit Me Up?**\n\nHit Me Up is New York City’s curated community for poly and kink. We run meetups, parties, and teach kink at House of Yes, Caveat, Torture Garden, and other venues around the city.\n\nWe got our start running small events for our friends that quickly outgrew multiple venues. Now we have our own space and we are working to build the kink and poly community that NYC deserves—safer, friendlier, and weirder.\n\n**Why is Hit Me Up different?**\n\nOur core value at Hit Me Up is that poly and kink should be FUN. We balance accessibility and friendliness with a selective approach to membership to ensure that we get to hang out and play in the community we want to exist. Safety and respect are the only things we always take seriously.\n\n**How do you keep your events safe?**\n\n❣️ Our rules are actually enforced. If we say there’s a dress code, we will actually turn away anyone who doesn’t put in the effort to follow it. See our full consent policy for more details.\n\n❣️ We don’t oversell our events. There will always be space to breathe, to get away, and to get into what you’re into.\n\n❣️ Aggressive, cruising, and abusive behavior are dealt with quickly.\n\n❣️ Complaints and reports get action. We will never choose an extra ticket sale over risk to our members.\n\nWe are the guardians of the community, the space and the vibe, and we take that responsibility seriously. All of these things add up, and we think it shows in our membership and the incredible and weird things that can happen at our events.\n\n**How Do I Become A Member?**\n\nTo join Hit Me Up, go to [hitmeupnyc.com/join](https://hitmeupnyc.com/join) and fill out the application. It helps if you have an existing member to put down as vouching for you, but it’s not necessary. Membership is completely free, and is purely for vetting and safety purposes.\n\n**Can I get in touch with you?**\n\nFeel free to email us, [hello@hitmeupnyc.com](https://hello@hitmeupnyc.com). Hit Me Up is run by Alice and Hawthorne, two sexy weirdos who get off on making truly magical events.\n\nFor regular updates and educational content, follow us on instagram: [@hitmeupnycity](https://www.instagram.com/hitmeupnycity/?hl=en) and sign up for our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter).\n\nThat was a lot of reading, huh? Here's the thing—our ideal members are ones who read all the way to the end. Thanks for being with us. (Or just skipping to the end like an impatient middle schooler. For shame!)",

    "description": "**Tantric Trance Dance 7:30pm-9:30pm**\n\n**_Address given in confirmation email additional info_**\n\n**Facilitated by** [Goddess Shakti](https://www.libglobal.org/)\n\n**Join us for an amazing evening of sacred spiritual energy!**\n\nEmbracing the Yoga of Sound and the essence of Hatha without doing typical asana poses that we have grown to believe in as an essential element of yoga.\n\nHatha (Ha-Tha, described as a “sun-Moon”)…. Nothing about poses.\n\nHatha is described as “sun-moon” to emphasize negative-positive, male-female, these two opposite forces in nature that we meditate upon to harness constructive forceful means to bring about change to our mental and emotional state.\n\nThis nourishing and playful practice encourages delicious trance, sensual body movement, and vocal Shakti invocation.\n\nIn this practice, we constructively and playfully rebel against convention. We approach yoga in an unconventional way with trance dance and using the power of our voice.\n\nRelish the experience of playfully cutting straight through the noise and chaos of various unpredictable mental states and life and take a break from the stubborn sticky impulses of ego in a trance-supported ecstatic dance practice.\n\nThrough this technique we experience the blissful absorption of yoga’s final stages: dhyana, yoga's 7th limb, and then finally, potentially the final 8th stage-Samadhi.\n\nThis is a specific progression of movement modes that promote delightfully deep meditation.\n\nThere are no complex or challenging poses or dance moves to work out. You do not need to think, figure things out, or worry how you look.\n\nYou are in a totally supportive space that has been infused with unconditional love. We will engage in a tonal voice technique that will help us to tune the divine instruments that we are and harmonize ourselves with the unified field of consciousness as we slide into a deep and peaceful meditative and free state.\n\n**The Workshop Experience:** This is an in-person workshop/gathering in a beautiful and private studio space in Manhattan (near Herald Square). The workshop will include 2.5 hours of mingling, getting to know your fellow humans, spiritual connections and movement.\n\n**Desired Benefits:** You will gain new ways to connect and bond with yourself and your fellow humans. You will be able to connect and explore your own relationship to this practice and all the yummy sensations possible. Opt in event meaning you only do what you feel comfortable with.\n\n*   Release the emotional baggage that accumulates in the body due to exposure to traumas in our life and causes us to suffer.\n*   Experience a practice of yoga that is incredibly liberating\n*   Re-set the nervous system and get a good physical work out for our bodies\n*   Induce in ourselves a state of excellent and bliss-filled meditation.\n*   Experience oneness (the goal of yoga)\n*   FEEL FREE & HAVE FUN\n\n**What to bring?**\n\n*   Wear fun or fancy dressy dancy clothes (or be liberated to opt for your natural state) for your enjoyment. If you opt to wear clothes, be sure that they allow free movement and sitting comfortably in meditation.\n*   Bring water or at least a water bottle\n*   Bring meditation cushion and/or yoga mat. (mats are available if you don't have)\n\n**Workshop Tickets:** Early Bird $30, Regular $40\n\n**NOTE:** We encourage everyone to have an open mind as this is a fun, open and explorative learning environment. We practice and review informed & ongoing consent practices with an emphasis on mutual opt in desire. This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, and we do not pair anyone as we honor genuine connections that arise in the evening.\n\nThis event is perfect and open for all experience levels.18+ for workshops. Refunds must be requested 24hrs prior to the event. Doors open at 7:30pm and closes at 7:45 pm please be on time.\n\nIf you have any more questions about this practice, email Goddess Shakti at [esotericyoga@protonmail.com](mailto:esotericyoga@protonmail.com)\n\nPagansParadise.com\n\nDaddyRetreat.com",

Workshop 7:30-10 pm**\n\nFacilitated by [Dominus Eros](https://www.dominuseros.com/)\n\n**Join us in the fun and enticing worlds of Tantra and Communal Energy!**\n\n_This event is a solo practice and we do not pair people._\n\nFind yourself missing group experiences that are bonding, spiritual and connective in fun ways. Dominus invites you to an event that induces communal energy with Tantric edging via guided self energetic pleasure practices. We honor our solo journey energy while adding to a communal pool of positive energy.\n\nIn a world where we have minimal interpersonal spiritual connection that honors our own bodies and desires we look to move from stagnate and blocked energy into a space where we are open to abundant energy of love and pleasure while releasing shame and judgments. Whether you are by yourself or with a loved one this event can introduce you to new ways of exploration that start with the self.\n\nTantric principles are used during this event. Tantra is an eastern practice that can include balancing sexuaI energy within the body to create pleasure and intimate healing energy. Breath techniques connect to create a heightened state of 0rgasmic energetic flow, without release to 'edge' or create extended time before the moment of ultimate release of energy might occur. Energetic Edging is a great practice to build intensity and lengthen the experience of any self practice to allow for a deeper and more connected session.\n\nYou will learn how to edge yourself, explore singular and multiple internal energetic releases, create tantric body waves, and connect with your breath and internal energy to heighten energetic sensations before ultimate energetic release.\n\nBody movements, positions, breathwork and sound creation are used to find vibrations, frequencies, tones and patterns to elicit the wavelength that we want to enjoy and be present in. You will learn to move in and out of wavelengths of intensity and ultimately have full control of your mind, body and spirit with regards to intimate and sexual energy which becomes a gift to oneself.\n\n**The Workshop Experience:** This is an in-person workshop in a beautiful and private studio space in Manhattan (near Union Square). The workshop will include 2.5 hours of discussion & instruction where you will be able to receive and explore new techniques and positions. If you desire, you may receive hands-on practice and demonstration. You will stay with yourself the entire time, we do not pair people up.\n\n**Desired Benefits:** You will gain new ways to connect and bond with yourself and your partner that feel intimate, exciting and invigorating. You will be able to connect and explore your own relationship to this practice and all the yummy sensations possible.\n\n*   Introduction to basic Tantric Theory\n*   Safety protocol, negotiations, and aftercare\n*   Group led meditative sequence using Kundalini Cobra Breath\n*   Body movements and extended breathwork gets explored\n*   Practical techniques and live demo - You will learn how to do things safely and effectively\n*   Exploration of touch with spiritual intention\n*   Yoni and Lingham Energetic Tantric self massage techniques and demonstration\n*   Rising Kundalini Energy through awakening a full body energetic release\n*   For optional self oil massage bring big towels and comfy minimal clothing\n*   Group energetic free play with guided energetic edglng\n*   Oil and more will be available to add to your session\n\n**What to bring?**\n\n*   Large towel/blanket, comfy minimal clothing, any items to enhance your personal experience\n*   Open, curious minds\n\n**Workshop Tickets: Early Bird $30, Regular $40**\n\n_NOTE: We encourage everyone to have an open mind as this is a fun, open and explorative learning environment.

Sinema Club stimulates yours with films that are explicitly erotic, homo-romantic, or gender-exploring -- and always thought-provoking. A rousing discussion follows; drinking is encouraged throughout, and mingling happens before, during and after: the bar remains open for socializing, while the film plays in the main space. Plus: free popcorn from our vintage cart. Order dinner in, and make it dinner and a movie.\n\nThis months screening: hot hot hot noir vampire classic The Hunger (1983) with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie\n\nWhen The Hunger was first released, it got mediocre reviews: dismissed as a stylistic triumph at best, but not a particularly noteworthy addition to the vampire movie genre. Yet more than 40 years later, the film remains a cult classic. It's not difficult to see why: look just a little bit beneath the surface of the plot -- a couple of sexy-as-all-hell vampires approach a beautiful young doctor (Susan Sarandon!) when one of the immortals finds they're having a serious health problem -- and you get unexpectedly poignant themes of mortality and loss of long-term domestic partnership alongside the more familiar tropes of power, sex, and bloodsucking. And of course, the film remains aesthetically breathtaking.\n\nOur screening of The Hunger will be followed by a talkback with Nancy Roche, noted writer and academic. Nancy currently teaches film studies with emphases on gender and identity at Belmont University. We will discuss the film -- and vampire mythos in general -- through a queer lens.\n\nSinema Club is curated and hosted by Phil Guie-Ng (@thatphilguymovies): an inquisitive, ardent longtime film critic who is dying to tell you about movies you haven't heard of yet. As a reviewer at the website Film-Forward, his self-appointed mission was covering documentaries and features about subjects who challenged conventional attitudes about gender, masculinity, and more. When Phil isn't writing about movies, you can find him in Brooklyn taking part in protests on behalf of basic human rights.\n\n\\*Sinema Club happens on the third Wednesday of every month\n\n\\*\\*\\*Plus: House of Scorpio Clubhouse. Whatever your membership level, you are invited to use our space as your own for the night...as your clubhouse. While the ticketed activities will take place on the stage side of the room, the bar and lounge will remain open 7pm-11pm (12am if enough people are lounging). Just like with regular events, if you're Friend level and above, you can bring up to two friends with you. Order in dinner, have a few drinks, run a friendly board game, or just read a book on the comfy couch. This is not a mixer -- just us opening our doors for our members. It's up to you how much you socialize, if at all, and with whom.\n\nCOVID safety: HoS requires proof of vaccination on file; masks encouraged; two hospital grade UV air purifiers will cycle the air.",

    "description": "Come learn some ways to make your bottoms wiggle and squirm with predicaments!\n\n**Hit Me Up: Tie Me Down - Intermediate Precarious Predicaments**\n\nYou've learned some cute ties, but now you want to learn to make someone squirm. The beauty of predicaments is that no matter which way they wiggle, your bottom is going to feel.... something. The struggle is amusing and relief is debatable.\n\nIn this class we will discuss what makes a predicament and how to create tension with rope. We will start with a floor tie and then a couple variations of partial suspensions to add to the wiggling. We will cover adding elements like hair rope, toe rope, gags and bamboo. There will be some smaller diameter jute rope that is great for hair rope available for use during class, and if you really like using it you can buy it after class.\n\nThis class is labeled at intermediate, which means you are solid with your single column and double column ties. But, this class is beginner friendly in the way that you do not need to know any specific harnesses to participate. We will also go over uplines and how to best utilize them for this type of scene.\n\nBring your full rope kit (this should include full lengths, half lengths of high quality rope such as jute, nylon or hemp) as well as your preferred rigging equipment (strap, ring and/or carabiners) and cutting shears. If you do not have rigging gear, you can purchase a climbing strap and carabiner at REI before class. We will mostly be using the hard point for stability, so you don’t need anything too fancy. You should also bring a fabric blind fold and smaller rope if you have it (4mm or twine is ideal!)\n\nTops: As this is labeled an intermediate class, you should be confident about your single column and double column ties. You should also have solid knowledge of basic frictions. If you need a refresher before class, review some of the videos here: [www.youtube.com/@TrixieLaPointe](http://www.youtube.com/@TrixieLaPointe)\n\nBottoms: You must feel comfortable being bound in challenging positions but also skilled at communicating your needs.\n\nAll bodies are welcome! There will be modifications offered for all body types and flexibility.\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\nMistress Trixie LaPointe is a professional rope artist, dominatrix, performer and educator based in NYC. She has been exploring rope since 2018 and has been sharing her knowledge via classes and private lessons since 2021. She has been regularly seen working as a service top or performing at House of Love, House of X, Tempo by Hit Me Up, Femme Fatale, Chemistry and other events around NYC. She is proud proprietor of her own studio space La Maison Privée in Manhattan, where she holds various sessions as well as small classes and events.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n_What should I bring?_\n\nBring your full rope kit (this should include full lengths, half lengths of rope) as well as your prefered rigging equipment (strap, ring and or carabiners) and cutting shears. You should also bring a fabric blind fold/gag and smaller rope if you have it (4mm or twine is ideal!)\n\n_What should I wear?_\n\nWhatever you feel comfy in! Bodysuits, shorts or snug fitting workout clothes are generally perfect for classes. Please just keep your bottoms on!\n\n_Any pre-requisite skills needed?_\n\n**Tops**: As this is labeled an intermediate class, you should be confident about your single column and double column ties. You should also have solid knowledge of basic frictions. If you need a refresher before class, review some of the videos here: www.youtube.com/@TrixieLaPointe\n\n**Bottoms**: You must feel comfortable being bound in challenging positions but also skilled at communicating your needs.\n\n_Can I attend solo, or do I need to come with a partner?_\n\nThis class will be limited to 10 pairs - no solo tickets will be sold so you must come with a partner. Please note - if you are planning to switch, there might not be enough time for you to try every tie twice.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**STAY IN TOUCH!**\n\nInstagram [@hitmeupnycity](http://www.hitmeupnyc.com/hitmeupnycity)\n\nJoin our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter)\n\n✨Location: Lower Manhattan.

    "description": "Join the Downtown Brooklyn Roundtable for Polyamory/Non-monogamy on **October 17,** at the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture (www.bsec.org) - 269 4th Avenue, between Garfield and 1st Street (Brooklyn). This event recurs on the **Third Thursday** of every month.\n\nThe topic will be updated few days before the event.\n\nA couple of important reminders:\n\n*   We kindly ask for a **suggested $10 donation** to help us cover room rental\n*   We can bring food/drinks to share (yay!), but please keep in mind the event is still centered on the discussion vs. being a potluck\n\nThe Poly Roundtable is a discussion-centered community gathering for those who want to learn about and share experiences/perspectives on topics related to non-monogamy and polyamory. This includes newcomers to poly, long-time practitioners, and those just testing the waters. Folks get a chance to make new friends, learn from each other, share their unique stories and exchange insights that can support successful and healthy non-monogamous relationships. We hope you can join us to contribute, learn, or both!\n\n**Approximate Timeline:**\n\n• Doors Open - 7 PM\n\n• 7-7:30 - Arrive, get your name tags, say hi, place your drinks/snacks on the table\n\n• 7:30-9 - Group discussion\n\n• 9-10 - Mingle and socialize (and help us clean up the space ;))\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** This meetup is about creating a safe space for sharing ideas and experiences and having productive and compassionate discussions with old and new friends. It is not a cruising or pickup event, so please do not come with those expectations or intentions as they can make folks uncomfortable and feel unsafe. Help us keep this a safe and supportive space!\n\nOur group values ethics, inclusion, growth and compassion as a means to support each of our unique journeys in developing non-traditional relationships. Please be prepared to bring those values, along with an awareness of the fundamental importance of consent and a respect for all others if you attend our events.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming everyone interested or curious about non-monogamy and polyamory :) See you at our new space, the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture (269 4th Avenue, between Garfield and 1st Street)!\n\nIn Community,\n\n~ Clara, Faun & Marco",

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Influence & Control\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\n**Influence & Control**\n\n*   **Beyond Physicality**: Discover ways to make someone melt - without even touching them!\n*   **Building Trust**: Learn how to create a safe container for power exchange that allows for vulnerability and growth.\n*   **The Dom/me Detector**: I’ll share my technique for “scanning” your sub for the buttons they’re begging you to push, even if they’re unaware of them! \n*   **Understanding Desires**: You can’t make someone melt in your hands if you don’t understand what they desire. \n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> POWER PLAY: Fall Series (Thursdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n> Pain & Physicality (Oct 10th)\n\n> Influence & Control (Oct 17th)\n\n> Resistance & Brat Taming (Oct 24th)",

Come to 9 Bob Note in costume if you can to celebrate the Swedish pop goddess Robyn at the original and longest-running Robyn party and the best pop night on the planet!\n\nHappy October, this one's feeling special... THERE JUST MIGHT BE SOME TREATS IN STORE...😉 😮\n\nThe now-legendary party and its DJs/creators Russ Marshalek, Marley Magaziner, and Chris Choyce were featured by none other than Robyn herself in her short film Missing U, where she drops in on the party for a surprise DJ set.\n\nAt The Robyn Party you'll hear all of Robyn's hits, b-sides, lost tracks, remixes, aaaannnd just maybe some tunes you won't hear elsewhere, along with your other pop faves like Carly, Charly, Romy, Gaga, and more. It's a euphoric, uplifting, cry-dancing, life-changing night.\n\nMusically, we’re gonna get a little weird, a little weird, a little dark. We’ve got some of the darkest stuff and most dance floor-haunting Robyn remixes and creepy femme pop - and then, of course, more Robyn.\n\nEvery year, Robyn-O-Ween is a chance for us to spread our bat wings, “show me your teeth”, and play some tracks that might not always fit at This Party Is Killing You! otherwise, so if you have a haunted pop fave you’ve just been dying hear: send your requests to adventuresbk@gmail.com\n\nOur special guest for this night of Halloween-flavored pop goodness is OHAILEIGH, aka Leigh Barton, from St Vitus, from the internet and from the video for Missing U. She's been a friend and a collaborator for a loooong time and we're excited to welcome her to DJ with us. She spends a lot of time in and around Saint Vitus and with Vitus Presents, and has been called \"too spooky\" - so we can't wait to hear what she has up her sleeves for us.\n\nThere will be multiple costume contests, so if you feel like it - dress to impress:\n\n\\-Best Robyn Related cosutme-Best Non-Robyn Pop Diva-Best Group-Judges Fave\n\nFor prizes you won't want to miss, and just might have some once in a lifetime chances to win exclusive stuff. And, of course, lots of tricks, and even more treats.\n\nSome special tunes, giveaways, and surprises are in store...so hold tight! You'll understand why more than one fake plastic fang-wearing, fake-blood-covered sweat-drenched partygoer has been heard to exclaim \"The Robyn Party saved my life!\"\n\n Send haunted femme pop song requests and ALL THE ROBYN REQUESTS!! to adventuresbk@gmail.com \n\n———————————————\n\nNO REFUNDS\n\n\\*THIS IS A 21 AND OLDER EVENT\\* VALID PHYSICAL FORM OF ID IS REQUIRED ( NO PHOTOS )\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*The administrative fee, extension/late ending charges, room/area rental fees, and all other charges and fees charged to your event are not gratuities and will not be distributed as gratuities to the service staff providing service to guests (or any other staff), but will be retained by 9 BOB NOTE in connection with and to offset the overhead, operating, and administrative expenses associated with your event.",

Gender Affirming Intimacy is a workshop geared towards helping ourselves, partners, or other loved ones experience the opposite of dysphoria, gender euphoria!\n\nWe'll explore how positive, gender-affirming physical, emotional, & mental intimacy can make ourselves or others feel more aligned with their beautiful, authentic selves.\n\n### We'll achieve this by covering:\n\n*   Learning terminology around Trans bodies\n*   Identification of the multiple forms of intimacy\n*   Creating euphoria through affirming language\n*   Adapting to different forms of sexual & non-sexual touch\n*   Finally, towards the end of this class, we will help you develop your own “Gender Affirming Profile” or navigate helping a trans partner create their own Gender Affirming Profile!\n\nGender non-conforming people may also benefit from pieces of this to create their own unique Gender-Affirming Profiles. People who are not familiar with trans bodies or terminology are also encouraged to attend.\n\nWe are here to educate without stigma! Please note this class is GREAT for partners of trans people & trans people alike!

    "description": "Join Petite Pretzel and KinkNamePending for an evening class on predicament bondage tailored specifically for the AMAB rope bottom. Our seasoned sadist, Pretzel, and power bottom, KNP, teach the art of prolonging and intensifying your bottom's suffering with meticulous precision. This is an open-ended exploration where students are encouraged to adapt the concepts to suit their unique dynamics and preferences. There's no one-size-fits-all approach; it's about embracing the process of learning and relishing the overall experience.\n\nIn this class, we delve into predicament bondage: crafting dilemmas that force the rope bottom to choose between different forms of pain, exhaustion, or humiliation. This is not a collaborative tie; it's a constantly evolving game of cat-and-mouse. The rope bottom seeks escape or respite, and the top skillfully removes those options, creating a captivating dance of control and surrender.\n\nAs your “evil genius” guide, Pretzel thrives on creating challenges that evolve into prolonged and increasingly difficult struggle. Her class \"A Rock and a Hard Place: Predicaments for Penis-Owners\" aims to strike a balance. It's not about making it so challenging that one gives up immediately or so easy that boredom sets in; it's about creating a dialogue through rope. The ropes become a medium for communication, a conversation where suggestions and responses inspire each other.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs.\n\n### [RSVP](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=67520093) $140 per pair\n\n_$60 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class_\n\n#### **This class will cover:**\n\n*   Detailed anatomical information, to improve the efficacy of predicaments and ensure safety\n*   Psychological discussion of the perspectives of both top and bottom\n*   Intimate ties for genitals, specifically penis and testicles\n\n#### **Who can attend this class? Are there prerequisites?**\n\n*   Riggers should know how to proficiently tie the TK and proficient at tying mainlines/suspension lines.\n*   Riggers must know how to check for nerve impingement. You must inform your model of the risks of rope suspension.\n*   Riggers and models must have tied together prior to this class\n*   Rope bottoms should be able to be tied in an upper body harness and be very familiar with the differences between nerve and circulation impingement.\n*   Models must be able to recognise and communicate signs of nerve impingement to riggers effectively and timely. Models should be able to process pain and take enjoyment in intense sensations.\n\n#### **What should I bring and what do I wear?**\n\nPeople usually wear comfortable clothing like yoga or dance attire. We advise against loose fitting clothing and also jeans can sometimes feel a bit restrictive to move around in and difficult to tie on. Bring your own rope.\n\n#### **Who teaches this class?**\n\nPetite Pretzel is a rope switch from New York City. She has been teaching shibari (Japanese rope bondage) since 2019 at Anatomie Studio London, as well as at other UK venues (Oxford Rope Bight, Tangled Festival Derby, Edinburgh Rope Showcase), and abroad in the USA (Temple NYC), Greece (Athens Shibari), Germany (Eurix), and Sweden (Stockholm Pride). She has performed and taught live for Shambala Festival, Pinky Promise, Riposte Queer Rave, Fox & Badge. Her commercial rigging includes music video credits (Charli XCX, Christine + the Queens), art gallery installation (Elizabeth Xi Bauer gallery), fashion photography and full-length film. She lives in Bethnal Green with her cat, who loves ropes just as much as she does. You can find her on Twitter as @PetitePretzel and Instagram as @Petite\\_Pretzel. \n\nPen (KinkNamePending) is a UK-based rope switch from Croydon, South London. He loves the connections that shibari inspires and the wide range of experiences with vulnerability and trust it has brought him. Outside of rope, he is keenly interested in anatomy and physiology and has studied these topics extensively. He brings his perspective and understanding of the human body into rope and kink. He has performed in the UK as a rope-bottom at Tangled Festival, the Lust Supper, Pinky Promise and Fox Badge; and additionally abroad at Temple NYC in the USA, Eurix (European Rope Exchange) in Germany and for Stockholm Pride in Sweden. You can find him on Twitter and Instagram as @KinkNamePending.",

    "description": "We will be discussing the barriers regarding changing or ending partnerships, and how to move through them in new and imaginative ways.\n\nThe idea of ending or even changing a relationship dynamic with someone, is terrifying, partly because we fear losing someone we have grown intimate with and because of the messaging we've received about romantic partnerships from the dominant culture leading us to view breaking up, or even a relationship taking on a different form, as the relationship failing. This idea keeps people in relationship dynamics that are no longer serving them, barring them from their own authentic needs and desires.\n\nChampioning our own autonomy and our partner's(s) is crucial, in welcoming shifts to our relationships if something is not working for us.\n\nThis workshop dives into the emotional and tangible impact of major relationship shifts, and how to move them with compassion, grace and self assuredness.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\\-Tools on how to initiate and welcome ALL major changes in relationships\n\n\\-Deepened understanding of the \"relationship escalator\" and how it influences why we stay in relationship structures that no longer serve us\n\n\\-Templates, ceremonies and rituals on how to have a conscious, proactive and loving decoupling\n\n**About Your Instructors**\n\nBear (he/him) & Fifi (all pronouns) are New York City-based Intimacy Coaches, Community Consultants, Event Producers, and Educators.

Lola Jean has a gift of gab, but she designed this class for even the timidest of speakers.\n\nWhether words are your only tool or just a little sprinkle to your scene, you don't need to be a tongue twisting wordsmith to master mental domination. Verbal domination pulls from many of the same tactics as physical, only your words are the tools. Learn how to trap someone in their own mind and use their thoughts against them. When we play with mind the only bounds are that of our imagination. We can play in fantasy as much as we play in reality.\n\nWe will run the gamut from sweet to sadistic. In this class you will learn how to incorporate more verbal elements pre, during, and post-scene. Learn how to use someones words to inspire and further the scene, how to create a world that isn't there and how to find, expose and RELEASE an insecurity.\n\nIn addition to these overall concepts, you will walk away with several tactics and tools build to confuse, gain intel, and direct particular attention to the words you are saying. Lola Jean pulls well beyond typical domination approaches by weaving in learnings from the hypnosis, thespian, and journalism communities.\n\n**FAQ: what should I bring?**\n\npen and paper for notetaking if you feel so inclined\n\n**FAQ: what should I wear?**\n\nwhatever your heart desires\n\n**FAQ: any skill pre-requisites? (i.e., is this for beginners, advanced, everyone?)**\n\nfor anyone - beginner or pro\n\n**FAQ: can I attend solo, or do I need to come with a partner?**\n\nsolo or partnered!\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\nLola Jean is a Sex Educator, Fetish Wrestler, headmistress of 7 Days of Domination, and World Record Holder for Volume Squirting (solo.) providing the No Frills Sex Education we both need and deserve.

We’ll set up puzzles that people bring and you can decide to offer an exchange, leave with the ones you came with, or donate to the group and I’ll bring any leftovers to future events! Since it is spooky season, we will have some Halloween jigsaw puzzles to work on together while we hang, as well as some metal puzzles and banangrams so there’s something for everyone! \n\nThis bar has an outdoor area on the sidewalk for any who prefer to stay outdoors due to Covid reasons. \n\nThere is a kitchen at the bar where you can order food. The bar asks that everyone order at least one drink or food item since they are letting us use the space. \n\nPlease note: the bar will still be open to the public, so we will just be enjoying puzzling and swapping puzzles respectfully. Unfortunately due to this we cannot control mask wearing or exposure concerns. This is a queer bar and a safe space for our community from what I have experienced. \n\nFinal notes: this is a ground level bar with one small step in regard to accessibility. Everyone is welcome to stay and enjoy the bar before/after the event!\n\nI look forward to meeting you and puzzling together! 🤗 🧩",

We will make it easy for you by introducing basic safety and tool concepts before moving onto basic rope restraint techniques. These rope ties can be used decoratively and restrictively in a variety of positions, which can be customized to meet yours and your partners' physical abilities and personal goals.\n\nSome topics to be covered:\n\n\\- Why rope?\n\n\\- Safety basics\n\n\\- Rope tension\n\n\\- Scene experience options\n\nDemos & practice:\n\n\\- Connected tying demo/exercise\n\n\\- Beginner friendly Wrist & Ankle Cuffs with Options\n\n\\- Basic Chest Harness with Flexibility Options\n\n\\- Simple Full Body Harness\n\nAll BB classes are a mixture of lecture, hands-on experience, and dedicated Q&A time. After class, stay for dedicated practice & play time to help you solidify your skills, while our teacher remains available for guidance. Class and practice are in the main space, while the bar lounge is open 7pm-12am if you want to arrive early or leave late -- or just need a break. Always BYO practice items, where relevant, though we will always have a selection on hand.\n\nOur teacher: Multithreaded/Mike (He/Him) Is a long time rope enthusiast with 10+ years of experience in the NYC Rope/Kink community. He enjoys exploring the power and versatility of rope as a creative act of communication, connection, and shared experience through an improvisational and observant style. He also enjoys sharing knowledge and helping others along their rope journey. \n\nBedroom Badass is our series of workshops to take couples and individuals through various steps in opening up their relationships, or in exploring more adventurous sexual experiences. Whether you're a total novice or an old pro, each class has a range of information relevant to all experience levels.\n\n\\*Bedroom Badass happens on the second and fourth Wednesday of each month\n\n\\*\\*HoS rules: HoS membership required; dress code, PAL or prior approval not required; Code of Conduct always applies; no photos except in the designated front area.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Plus: House of Scorpio Clubhouse.\n\nWhatever your membership level, you are invited to use our space as your own for the night...as your clubhouse. While the ticketed activities will take place on the stage side of the room, the bar and lounge will remain open 7pm-11pm (12am if enough people are lounging). Just like with regular events, if you're Friend level and above, you can bring up to two friends with you. Order in dinner, have a few drinks, run a friendly board game, or just read a book on the comfy couch. This is not a mixer -- just us opening our doors for our members. It's up to you how much you socialize, if at all, and with whom.\n\nCOVID safety: HoS requires proof of vaccination on file; masks encouraged; two hospital grade UV air purifiers cycle the air.",

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Resistance & Brats\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\nResistance & Brat Taming\n------------------------\n\n*   **The Dance of Resistance**: Understand the dynamics of resistance and how to use it to heighten the tension and excitement in your scenes.\n*   **Taming the Brat**: Learn the art of brat taming, how to enjoy playful resistance, and transform it into a powerful exchange of energy.\n*   **Power Struggles**: When you feel a “Clash” between you and your counterpart, learn how to move the energy.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants. During the jam, you'll have the opportunity to practice your new skills on dungeon furniture in a safe and supportive environment. Nix & Rrrob will be available to offer feedback or conduct activities that cement workshop learning. This is a unique chance to develop muscle memory through hands-on experience, working and learning together in a playful setting.\n\n#### Workshop 7:30-9:30 pm - Jam 9:45pm-11:45pm\n\n#### _Near Herald Square / Address given in confirmation email additional info / Elevator Access available at this location_\n\n#### Pricing:\n\n● **Workshop**: Early Bird $30, Classic $40\n\n● **Workshop and Jam**: Early $55, Classic $75\n\nSAVE WHEN YOU GO TO ALL FOUR: Workshops $140 or Workshop + Jams $260\n\n> POWER PLAY: Fall Series (Thursdays @ Herald Square)\n\n> Power Dynamics 101 (Oct 3rd)\n\n> Pain & Physicality (Oct 10th)\n\n> Influence & Control (Oct 17th)\n\n> Resistance & Brat Taming (Oct 24th)",

Come for the workshop and stay for the Jam to practice what you learned and meet other like-minded folks!_**\n\n**Are you ready to experience a divine merging of the er0tic and the spiritual?**\n\nStep into the world of _Shamanic Bondage_, where the ancient practices of Shibari and Kundalini energy awaken your Eros and bring you into alignment with the divine.\n\nJoin us at Pagan's Paradise for an immersive and transformative journey where submission becomes sacred and energy rises from your root to your crown. **This is** a chance to explore the deeper realms of er0tic energy and self-awareness, to release old blockages, and to connect with your own divine essence.\n\n**Event Highlights**\n\n**Beginner's Rope Safety & Chaos Rope Ritual:** Learn basic knots and frictions in a way that focuses on grounding and divine submission, rather than restraint.\n\n**Kundalini Activation & Chakra Alignment:** Awaken your Kundalini energy through breathwork and visualization, allowing your body’s energy to rise naturally and align with your highest self.\n\n**Essential Oils & Plant Medicine:** Experience the transformative power of scent through anointing with sacred oils that anchor energy and enhance your journey.\n\n**Soundscapes & Binaural Beats:** Guided by the soothing vibrations of low-frequency soundscapes, dive deep into the shamanic journey of self-discovery and energy awakening.\n\nThis session will leave you feeling grounded, empowered, and more deeply connected to both yourself and your partner.

We’ll start with an opening circle where each person can share their intentions for the evening.\n\n**Breathwork & Kundalini Activation:** The first part of the evening will be dedicated to breathwork, guiding you through deep inhalations and exhalations to flex the perineum and channel energy from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. You'll feel the subtle rise of energy within your body.\n\n**Rope Ritual:** You’ll then engage in a rope ritual that focuses on using basic knots and chaos rope techniques. The goal is to create a container for surrender and submission—not just to your partner but also to the divine energy that flows through you.\n\n**Shamanic Journey & Visualization:** This will be the heart of the experience. Through guided visualization, you will enter a meditative trance state supported by the healing properties of binaural beats and essential oils. You will feel your Kundalini energy spiral through your chakras, aligning and awakening your energy system.\n\n**Integration:** At the end of the session, you’ll have time to slowly reintegrate, untie, and reflect on your experience in a closing circle. This will be a time for sharing and grounding.\n\n**Ongoing Benefits:** After the session, you will take home tools to continue this practice and stay connected to the energy that was raised. You’ll learn how to maintain the alignment of your chakras and keep your Kundalini energy activated.\n\n**For the Adventurous Souls**\n\n*   This is not just an experience—it's a call to the soul. Come prepared to explore both the light and the shadow of your own energy, your body, and your connection to the divine. Whether you're a seasoned rope bunny or new to Shamanic practices, this offering is open to all who are ready to embrace their inner power and let the Kundalini rise.\n\n**Benefits for Participants:**\n\n*   **Emotional and Psychological Healing:** Combining these practices helps release emotional blockages and fosters a deeper connection with oneself and others​\n*   **Enhanced Connection:** Learn tools and techniques to strengthen bonds with partners, creating a deeper sense of intimacy and trust.\n*   **Therapeutic Properties:** Discover the calming and healing effects of essential oils and how they can support mental and physical health.\n*   **Spiritual Growth:** Experience a guided shamanic journey that opens pathways to spiritual insights and personal transformation.\n\n#### **Workshop Format:**\n\n● **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop includes a mix of theoretical discussion and hands-on practice, allowing you to learn and apply new skills in real-time.\n\n● **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner.

    "description": "This class will teach ties that incorporate a thin bamboo stick by tying it against the body. The ties are designed to introduce an additional element of restriction, when tying on the floor, utilizing the rigidness of the bamboo stick as opposed to the very pliable quality of rope.\n\nWe start the class by techniques to attach rope, body and bamboo together well, as this can be a challenge as bamboo is a slippery surface to tie on. Then specific ties, with themes like posture, exposure and torment, are taught. Detailing matters of placement of bamboo along the body, with body mechanics in mind, to achieve the desired effect.\n\nThis is a mixed level class suitable for students confident in fundamental tying techniques; You need to be able to tie single column tie well, without teacher support, and have prior experience in attending Shibari classes or workshops. It is not recommended as an introduction to shibari. Switching roles between ties is welcome if both partners are capable, but not mandatory.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $120 per tying pair\n\n_$40 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class_\n\nRSVP\n----\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event.

He has been working with rope professionally, primarily through teaching and offering intimate sessions to clients, since 2016.\n\nAlthough a rope top most of the time, he has broad experience as a rope bottom as well, and highly values ability to relate to both perspectives. He is a queer person, who appreciates tying with people of various gender. \n\n‘I consider kinbaku to be a complex erotic art, which is empathetically sadomasochistic at it’s core. Often tying in a way that can be challenging both for the one tying and the one in the ropes, my Shibari usually demands a lot of technical clarity when in the role of a teacher. At the same time, the student’s individuality is a priority when it comes to learning methods and intention. I view Kinbaku as a practice of continuous exploration – where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session, or over the course of a long partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time. For me, the essence of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional and sensual intention of the practice. And the more ones tying develop, the more seamlessly the parts can intermingle.’\n\nTamanduakinbaku.com",

    "description": "Tamandua visits NYC with Chuck as his model, to share his personal approach to Kinbaku, using some of his commonly used ties and techniques. The class concept will focus a lot on the ability to manage the intensity of a tie with subtle adjustments and calm assertiveness. During the workshop Tamandua will show some ties that when executed correctly, allow the top to easily control how intense they are for the bottom. The idea is to develop more confidence to play, especially in the territory of Semenawa – tormenting rope. Guidance on how to tie and get tied more fluently, in a more natural feeling way, using body/rope management and communicative cues, will be a big part of the learning material for both tops/riggers and bottoms/models. Tamandua and his partner will explain how these factors play into the ‘soft skills’ of rope bondage, and into the power exchange principles of erotically tormenting rope.\n\nTechnically, each tie is introduced through getting familiar with the basic building blocks which it is made up of. By learning the technical details of the harnesses used, and exploring how they feel and function under load of suspension, and simpler applications. As the final exercise each day, this collected knowledge gets put to the test when we enjoy a longer and (for top and bottom) more challenging tie.\n\n#### Requirements:\n\n*   Both tops/riggers AND bottoms/models need to have prior experience with suspension, and with TK/gote.\n*   Riggers need to have learned how to make and lock suspension lines safely, and know these techniques by heart.\n*   Riggers also need to be able to tie a solid TK, even though Tamandua’s variation will be taught in class, as this is a very high risk profile type of tie to learn for suspension. Therefore the workshop should not be one of your first experiences with TK suspension.\n*   All these skills need to have been learned through an experienced instructor IRL (not video).\n*   Everyone attending should be familiar with how to recognise signs of nerve damage, nerve impingement, and how to actively check for it during a tying session.\n*   Please review your skills before purchasing tickets.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $400 per tying pair for the weekend.\n\n_$160 deposit, $240 cash at the start of class._\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. If you would like a refund, please email us at temple.nyc.bushwick@gmail.com , and we will take care of it with you. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds.

    "description": "This evening is about suspension lines beyond their suitability to suspend. Rather, the focus will be on their ability to create tension, and the possibilities for play that open up when shifting to this point of view. Being able to handle a suspension line means more control over pressure, physical intensity and access to more postures for restraint as opposed to without. They are also greatly helpful for the rope top in order to manipulate and access the bottoms body without using as much strength.\n\nThe workshop is suitable for anyone with some type of prior education in suspension lines, including those who are not quite ready to suspend, but nonetheless want to familiarize themselves with using suspension points as a tool. For those already suspending this class can still be very beneficial in order to step back from routine and add more complexity to their tying sessions.\n\nWhile ties will be rather simple, basic techniques like attaching a suspension line to a harness, or locking off will not be taught. Therefore, it is not recommended that this is your very first introduction to suspension lines. Please make sure that you have received tuition in basic techniques prior to attending. Being able to tie a single column well is fundamental for all of the exercises. Ask someone experienced for feedback if unsure.\n\n4-5 jute ropes and 1 shorter rope will be needed.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $120 per tying pair for the weekend.\n\n_$40 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class._\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. If you would like a refund, please email us at temple.nyc.bushwick@gmail.com , and we will take care of it with you. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice of cancellation._\n\n[RSVP](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=67806564)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n#### **Tam’s Bio:**\n\nTamandua is a Swedish rigger based in Berlin, Germany. He has been working with rope professionally, primarily through teaching and offering intimate sessions to clients, since 2016.\n\nAlthough a rope top most of the time, he has broad experience as a rope bottom as well, and highly values ability to relate to both perspectives. He is a queer person, who appreciates tying with people of various gender. \n\n‘I consider kinbaku to be a complex erotic art, which is empathetically sadomasochistic at it’s core. Often tying in a way that can be challenging both for the one tying and the one in the  ropes, my Shibari usually demands a lot of technical clarity when in the role of a teacher. At the same time, the student’s individuality is a priority when it comes to learning methods and intention. I view Kinbaku as a practice of continuous exploration – where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session, or over the course of a long partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time. For me, the essence of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional and sensual intention of the practice. And the more ones tying develop, the more seamlessly the parts can intermingle.’",

    "description": "“FLoOr tIeS ArE eAsY” A Class of Definitely Not easy Floor Ties . An exploration of choosing the hard route.\n\n**“FLoOr tIeS ArE eAsY” A Class of Definitely Not easy Floor Ties - ADVANCED**\n\nWith complicated patterns and challenging positions, this class serves as a reminder to both tops and bottoms that you don't need uplines to make rope hard.\n\nThis class will explore two complex floor-based shapes--students will see each shape demonstrated in full and be given plenty of time to try out and play with the shapes themselves. This is an advanced rope class for both rigger and model, with the intention to challenge what we usually think of as \"difficult\" rope, by taking familiar structures and making them \\*more\\*.\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\nIn March of 2018 Sydona found her way into the NYC kink scene and never looked back. Since then, she's immersed herself into honing her rope practice, perhaps obsessively. She currently works full time as a nightlife performer, bondage artist, photographer, and creator. In these past several years she's traveled both within the U.S. and internationally for rope opportunities, as a performer, as a student, and more recently as an educator. Previous to 2020, Syd trained and worked as a professional modern and contemporary dancer, and is proud of the way she melds her thirteen odd years of experience as a movement artist into her current practice.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\nFAQ: what should I bring?\n\nA basic floor rope kit--at least six bundles of rope and a cutting tool\n\nFAQ: what should I wear?\n\nWhatever you feel comfy and can move in! Anything from yoga clothes to undies.\n\nFAQ: any skill pre-requisites? (i.e., is this for beginners, advanced, everyone?)\n\nRigger prerequisites: any single and double column tie, basic frictions, some experience building complex structures and following multi-step patterns, confident in rope communication skills, knowledge of safety and risk in rope\n\nBottom prerequisites: confident in-rope communication skills, knowledge of safety and risk in rope\n\nPlease note that this is an advanced rope class, and anyone who does not meet these prerequisites will be asked to observe.\n\nFAQ: can I attend solo, or do I need to come with a partner?\\*This is a partnered class!\n\nFor BIPOC and SWorkers - use cope EQUITY at checkout for a discount.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**STAY IN TOUCH!**\n\nInstagram [@hitmeupnycity](http://www.hitmeupnyc.com/hitmeupnycity)\n\nJoin our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter)\n\n✨Volunteers: Limited volunteer spots available.

    "description": "Learn how emotional intelligence makes a man truly high value, building deeper connections and self-awareness for life and relationships.\n\n**Hosted by Courtney Brame**\n\n**WORKSHOP:**\n\nThis workshop breaks down the modern concept of a \"High-Value Man,\" focusing not on superficial qualities but on the strength of emotional intelligence. Men will explore key topics such as emotional availability, self-awareness, and communication—learning to navigate relationships and life with greater depth and authenticity. Through guided exercises, you'll build tools for emotional regulation and discover what it means to be a truly \"high-value\" man from the inside out.\n\n**SOCIAL:**\n\nCome for the workshop, stay for the social. Enjoy drink specials, a discounted pop-up shop, and a beautiful garden patio perfect for mixing and mingling.\n\n**OUR PRESENTER:**\n\nCourtney Brame is the founder of Selfed, a platform that fosters emotional wellness for men through open dialogue, yoga, and self-inquiry.

The majority of our production team and cast represent BIPOC people from all over the world. We center the black experience in our performance art and immersive experiences. We bring focus to BIPOC.

Whether it's the first date, the 10th, or you're celebrating a milestone anniversary, we'd love to have you join us.\n\n**QUEER & STRAIGHT PEOPLE**\n\nOur entire company and those we work with include many from all aspects and identities of the Queer community (LGBTQIA2S+) All are welcomed into our community no matter who you are or who you're into.\n\n**KINK & BDSM**\n\nOur leadership team and production team are all BDSM and Kink practitioners, lifestylers, and/or professionals. While select feature performers may be Vanilla, our experiences, and shows are immersed in all kinds of subversive kinks if you want to see them. However, vanilla is a flavor, and those who identify as such can have an equally enjoyable experience. (Select BDSM events and play parties, due to their nature, are vetted and/or invite-only.)\n\n**SHADOWS OF INCLUSIVITY**\n\nThere are many areas of inclusivity any person or organization can choose to focus on. We are also keenly aware that due to trending or more socially acceptable forms of inclusivity and diversity, marginalized and oppressed people sometimes fall further into the shadows of inclusivity. Noting this, we also tend to cast and produce on the fringes and within the shadows often overlooked.\n\n**THE LIST** - Subscribe to the Siren Pack newsletter for first access to tickets and special enchantments: [http://bit.ly/SirenPackMailingList](http://bit.ly/SirenPackMailingList)\n\n**ABOUT SIREN PACK:** An immersive & subversive burlesque variety company producing provocative experiences.

Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

When Tier 1 sells out then Tier 2 is what's available.. and so on.\n\n**QUESTIONS:**\n\n**email:** [contact@shivaj.com](mailto:contact@ShivaJ.com)\n\n**COMMUNITY SUPPORT:** If you can comfortably afford to purchase your ticket at a higher tier....we encourage you to do so as that will make a lower tiered ticket available for someone in the community who may be in need of it due to their financial status. Thank you so much for kindly considering this\n\n**SOLO MALES**: This is a gender-balanced event and solo males must purchase a \"Solo Male\" ticket. The first couple of solo males will be \"confirmed automatically\"... after that, if registering alone, you will be placed on a waiting list. Your space in the event will be confirmed as soon as a matching solo female registers. If you are unable to be confirmed, your money will be fully refunded electronically the day after the event. Of course, another option is for you to find someone to register with as a pair.\n\n**A NOTE ABOUT GENITAL CONTACT:** There is no direct \"Manual-Genital Massage\" in this workshop... that is the specialization taught in a different course. However there is some \"Genital Brushing\"... where a part of the giver's body (for example, a forearm or a thigh) may brush with light to moderate pressure across the genitals of the receiver. This happens at very specific points in the massage sequence to activate & circulate the receivers sexual energy throughout \"their own body\". As with \"any\" exercise in this workshop, this is totally optional (as stated above) and if you desire not to experience this, the technique can be easily modified to fit your individual boundaries.\n\n**\\*ALL SOLO PARTICIPANTS (Female & Male):** This class is \"gender-balanced\" and usually filled with about 50-60% \"SOLO\" male & female participants.\n\n**ALL SOLO PARTICIPANTS** will be pairing up with a different solo participant of the opposite gender for each morning and afternoon session (3-4 hours in length) throughout the workshop. This is particularly helpful for learning the correct dynamics for effectively applying the techniques on different people (for example certain techniques need to be adjusted to be applied on a tall person as opposed to a shorter person etc.).\n\n**NOTE:** For the workshop to run smoothly, if you begin the workshop as a \"Solo\" participant (male or female) you will need to remain in that status throughout the duration of the workshop and change to a new practice partner of the opposite gender at every rotation point (every 3-4 hours).\n\n**IMPORTANT:** if you desire to work with a same gender partner you will need to attend as a pair. We truly wish it weren't the case, but unfortunately after many tries, it has turned out be too logistically complicated to accomplish within the rotating group of solo participants 🙏💗\n\n**SAME SEX COUPLES** are warmly invited to attend as a pair.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n*   This is a \"heart centered....touch positive....super-fun\"... and information-rich workshop.\n*   All personal boundaries will be Lovingly respected!\n*   All exercises are optional or \"negotiable\".\n*   You are welcome to wear a Covid mask if you wish.\n*   Open to SINGLES & COUPLES.\n*   COUPLES may do all exercises together if they wish.\n*   SAME SEX COUPLES are welcome to attend as a pair.\n\n**MORE DETAILS:**\n\n*   **CLOTHING:** Please dress so as to have as much skin exposed as possible (Women could wear thong bottom & bikini top & Men could wear a thong, briefs or boxers... nudity is also very acceptable and in fact encouraged.\n*   **PLEASE BRING:** (1) a sheet (2) a large towel & small hand towel (3) Massage oil (coconut oil?) preferably in a spill-proof dispenser! (4) Wet-Wipes (5) A bag lunch each day. Note that there will not be enough time to \"go out\" for lunch and we invite you to bring something to share with the group to help foster connection and community during our two days together.\n*   **MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:** I am confident that you will receive valuable skills, have plenty of Fun and feel enriched by this highly detailed journey....OR... your $$ back (minus any 3rd party processing fees... Must be requested within a week of the workshop completion). Seriously......I am absolutely committed to everyone's happiness, personal growth & satisfaction!\n*   **CANCELLATION POLICY:** 7 days notice required for a full refund (minus any 3rd party processing fees). After that point, I am happy to offer 50% of your registration as credit towards any of my future events.\n*   **BOUNDARIES:** We will create a \"safe space\" where everyone’s individual boundaries will be lovingly respected...…and all exercises are by personal choice only! This event is carefully designed so that attendees can choose to participate at the level that feels comfortable to them in each moment..…. and…..the conditions will be created for each person to play with and expand their boundaries at their own pace. You are invited to be in control of your own journey.\n\n### **MORE INFO can be found at:**\n\n[https://shivaj.com/tantricmassagemasterclass/](https://shivaj.com/tantricmassagemasterclass/)\n\n**ABOUT YOUR FACILITATOR:**\n\n**~ Shiva J** is a Certified Tantra Educator, Kundalini Yoga Instructor, Somatic Bodyworker, Certified Life Coach, Licensed Clinical Hypnotherapist, and Master NLP Practitioner who has been in the world of transformational work since 2003.\n\nWith a 20+ year career in the fitness world under his belt he suddenly found himself with a severe back injury that prevented him from continuing on that path. Around the same time he found himself facing divorce, bankruptcy and homelessness. Determined to rise from these pitfalls he began to study holistic wellness, and Tantra to help heal his body, mind and spirit. Having prevailed over a rather bleak and almost hopeless dark night of the soul he experienced a spiritual awakening and discovered his true calling as a healer, and community builder.\n\nWith his unique perspective of the mind, body, spirit connection he has helped thousands of clients transform their lives. He combines all of these unique tools along with his gift of insight to help his clients overcome any physical or mental challenge they may be currently experiencing in their lives.\n\nWhen not at work doing what he loves, Shiva J can be found at a local internet cafe sipping a dirty chai latte, attending ecstatic dancing, a drum circle, or out hiking or biking local trails and if you can't find him at all, he has probably taken a sabbatical and gone hiking or camping someplace more exotic!\n\n**Shiva J is available for private sessions, workshops and retreats.**\n\n[www.ShivaJ.com](http://www.shivaj.com)\n\n[www.TheSacredKings.com](http://www.thesacredkings.com)\n\n[www.TheHeartCenteredBeing.com](https://www.TheHeartCenteredBeing.com)\n\n**Facilitator** [Tantra Speed Date® San Diego](https://www.tantrany.com/tantra-speed-date/?region=sd&aff=7jj)\n\n**TESTIMONIALS:**\n\n_\"Embarking on this journey into the art of T@ntric/Sensu@l Massage was nothing short of magical!

Shiva J's teaching style is inclusive and respectful of individual boundaries. I now have a step-by-step outline for a 1-hour T@ntric Mass@ge session – pure gold!

The integration of diverse techniques, from Nuru Massage to Tai Chi, has enhanced my offerings. The emphasis on creating a safe space and respecting boundaries ensures a healing journey through connection.\"_\n\n_\"Shiva J's workshop is more than just a class; it's a community of growth and connection.
