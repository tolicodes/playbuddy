    "description": "We will be discussing the barriers regarding changing or ending partnerships, and how to move through them in new and imaginative ways.\n\nThe idea of ending or even changing a relationship dynamic with someone, is terrifying, partly because we fear losing someone we have grown intimate with and because of the messaging we've received about romantic partnerships from the dominant culture leading us to view breaking up, or even a relationship taking on a different form, as the relationship failing. This idea keeps people in relationship dynamics that are no longer serving them, barring them from their own authentic needs and desires.\n\nChampioning our own autonomy and our partner's(s) is crucial, in welcoming shifts to our relationships if something is not working for us.\n\nThis workshop dives into the emotional and tangible impact of major relationship shifts, and how to move them with compassion, grace and self assuredness.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\\-Tools on how to initiate and welcome ALL major changes in relationships\n\n\\-Deepened understanding of the \"relationship escalator\" and how it influences why we stay in relationship structures that no longer serve us\n\n\\-Templates, ceremonies and rituals on how to have a conscious, proactive and loving decoupling\n\n**About Your Instructors**\n\nBear (he/him) & Fifi (all pronouns) are New York City-based Intimacy Coaches, Community Consultants, Event Producers, and Educators. Their work challenges social binaries and standards, addresses the personal barriers that limit human connection, and offers alternative ways of relating that center consent & safety, authenticity, and personal agency on an interpersonal and collective scale.

Lola Jean has a gift of gab, but she designed this class for even the timidest of speakers.\n\nWhether words are your only tool or just a little sprinkle to your scene, you don't need to be a tongue twisting wordsmith to master mental domination. Verbal domination pulls from many of the same tactics as physical, only your words are the tools. Learn how to trap someone in their own mind and use their thoughts against them. When we play with mind the only bounds are that of our imagination. We can play in fantasy as much as we play in reality.\n\nWe will run the gamut from sweet to sadistic. In this class you will learn how to incorporate more verbal elements pre, during, and post-scene. Learn how to use someones words to inspire and further the scene, how to create a world that isn't there and how to find, expose and RELEASE an insecurity.\n\nIn addition to these overall concepts, you will walk away with several tactics and tools build to confuse, gain intel, and direct particular attention to the words you are saying. Lola Jean pulls well beyond typical domination approaches by weaving in learnings from the hypnosis, thespian, and journalism communities.\n\n**FAQ: what should I bring?**\n\npen and paper for notetaking if you feel so inclined\n\n**FAQ: what should I wear?**\n\nwhatever your heart desires\n\n**FAQ: any skill pre-requisites?

    "description": "Imagine yourself in a shibari laboratory—a place dedicated to the exploration of techniques, feelings, sensations, silence, dance, energy, animal instincts, meditation, philosophy, aesthetics, intensity, and discipline... all through the medium of rope. \n\nIn this space, you study a variety of techniques designed to open you up and bring more meaning to the dynamics of being gentle or tough. You learn to be mindful of breathing and emotional states, especially your own. The goal is to be as sincere and free as possible in the expression of shibari.\n\nThe four elements of shibari—\"Air,\" \"Earth,\" \"Fire,\" and \"Water\"—are not merely a classification within a body-oriented approach; they also serve as a philosophical foundation that can unlock even greater potential and value within you, inspiring a deeper connection with others. This foundation, built upon years of experience, is presented in a pragmatic form accessible to everyone.\n\nIn this introductory workshop we will touch in some of the main techniques that characterize this approach, such as:\n\n*   Theory of history and philosophy: \"4 Elements\" with demonstrations of each practice included in Shibari (Aikido, Thai massage, Contact Improv, Qigong, Tantra, BDSM)\n*   Body mechanics of movement and points of influence on the body\n*   Practice of four behavioral techniques for easier improvisation with ropes\n*   \"Ichi Nawa\": Working with one rope to create a sensual connection with a partner\n*   Different options for predicament ties\n*   Exploring the senses in sensual tying\n*   How to create a story with ropes\n*   Developing empathy\n*   Sensual \"4 Elements\" Gote Shibari and the art of touching your partner's heart\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n\n\\-       Single column tie\n\n\\-       Wrapping, tension and reverse tension\n\n\\-       Have an understanding of basic frictions: half hitch, nodome, yuki fix\n\n\\-   Gote (Tekate Kote) shibari ( some understanding, can be  rudimentary)\n\nSuitable for Beginner-Intermediate and Advanced levels\n\n#### Materials:\n\nYou need 4 ropes 7-8 meters long.\n\nBring comfortable clothing.\n\nIf you like to take notes during class, please bring pen and paper.\n\nThis workshop is ideally followed as a couple, but it is also possible to self-tie.\n\nSwitching is allowed.\n\n**You should know these shibari basics:**\n\n\\-       Single column tie\n\n\\-       Wrapping, tension and reverse tension\n\n\\-       Have an understanding of basic frictions: half hitch, nodome, yuki fix\n\n\\-   Gote (Tekate Kote) shibari\n\n#### **About Tati Limati**\n\nTati is a Ukrainian shibari artist and instructor.\n\nShe studied in Europe and Japan. Among others, her teachers were Naka Akira, Ren Yagami, Kinoko Hajime, Nicolas Yoroi. She also studied the Yukimura style. She has a background in aikido, tango, contact improvisation, femdom, tantra and other practices. She is currently studying to obtain a third higher education degree in psychology.\n\nTati is the organizer of international events in Ukraine and Poland and a regular contributor to Shibari Theatre in Asia and around the world. Tati is also a traveler. She currently lives in Thailand.\n\nOver the course of 12 years, Tati Limati has not just been training her rope skills, but researched many techniques and practices to integrate in her shibari practice. She combines elements of martial arts, contact improvisation, tantra, qi gong and Thai massage with the purpose of adding depth and sincerity to her own shibari work.\n\n In her teachings, she intends to help participants explore their underlying motivations and add deeper layers to their shibari play. With her techniques she aims to develop an understanding and the use of improvisation, making her students actively establish their own identities in rope play, instead of copying others without questioning.\n\n### [Ticket](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=69294263) per pair is $140\n\n#### Tickets are sold as pairs. _$60 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class. $140 total._\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event.

    "description": "📣 IT IS FINALLY HERE! ✨ OUR NEXT PUZZLE SWAP! There will be plenty more to come if you are unable to attend this one! \n\nWhen: Wednesday, October 23rd, 6-9pm\n\nWhere: Dromedary: Coming Out \n\n266 Irving Ave, Brooklyn NY 11237\n\nWhat: Puzzle Swap and Event! We’ll set up puzzles that people bring and you can decide to offer an exchange, leave with the ones you came with, or donate to the group and I’ll bring any leftovers to future events! Since it is spooky season, we will have some Halloween jigsaw puzzles to work on together while we hang, as well as some metal puzzles and banangrams so there’s something for everyone! \n\nThis bar has an outdoor area on the sidewalk for any who prefer to stay outdoors due to Covid reasons. \n\nThere is a kitchen at the bar where you can order food. The bar asks that everyone order at least one drink or food item since they are letting us use the space. \n\nPlease note: the bar will still be open to the public, so we will just be enjoying puzzling and swapping puzzles respectfully. Unfortunately due to this we cannot control mask wearing or exposure concerns. This is a queer bar and a safe space for our community from what I have experienced. \n\nFinal notes: this is a ground level bar with one small step in regard to accessibility. Everyone is welcome to stay and enjoy the bar before/after the event!\n\nI look forward to meeting you and puzzling together! 🤗 🧩",

We will make it easy for you by introducing basic safety and tool concepts before moving onto basic rope restraint techniques. These rope ties can be used decoratively and restrictively in a variety of positions, which can be customized to meet yours and your partners' physical abilities and personal goals.\n\nSome topics to be covered:\n\n\\- Why rope?\n\n\\- Safety basics\n\n\\- Rope tension\n\n\\- Scene experience options\n\nDemos & practice:\n\n\\- Connected tying demo/exercise\n\n\\- Beginner friendly Wrist & Ankle Cuffs with Options\n\n\\- Basic Chest Harness with Flexibility Options\n\n\\- Simple Full Body Harness\n\nAll BB classes are a mixture of lecture, hands-on experience, and dedicated Q&A time. After class, stay for dedicated practice & play time to help you solidify your skills, while our teacher remains available for guidance. Class and practice are in the main space, while the bar lounge is open 7pm-12am if you want to arrive early or leave late -- or just need a break. Always BYO practice items, where relevant, though we will always have a selection on hand.\n\nOur teacher: Multithreaded/Mike (He/Him) Is a long time rope enthusiast with 10+ years of experience in the NYC Rope/Kink community. He enjoys exploring the power and versatility of rope as a creative act of communication, connection, and shared experience through an improvisational and observant style. He also enjoys sharing knowledge and helping others along their rope journey. \n\nBedroom Badass is our series of workshops to take couples and individuals through various steps in opening up their relationships, or in exploring more adventurous sexual experiences. Whether you're a total novice or an old pro, each class has a range of information relevant to all experience levels.\n\n\\*Bedroom Badass happens on the second and fourth Wednesday of each month\n\n\\*\\*HoS rules: HoS membership required; dress code, PAL or prior approval not required; Code of Conduct always applies; no photos except in the designated front area.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Plus: House of Scorpio Clubhouse.\n\nWhatever your membership level, you are invited to use our space as your own for the night...as your clubhouse. While the ticketed activities will take place on the stage side of the room, the bar and lounge will remain open 7pm-11pm (12am if enough people are lounging). Just like with regular events, if you're Friend level and above, you can bring up to two friends with you. Order in dinner, have a few drinks, run a friendly board game, or just read a book on the comfy couch. This is not a mixer -- just us opening our doors for our members. It's up to you how much you socialize, if at all, and with whom.\n\nCOVID safety: HoS requires proof of vaccination on file; masks encouraged; two hospital grade UV air purifiers cycle the air.",

    "description": "### Workshop: POWER PLAY | Resistance & Brats\n\n**Hosted by Nix (the Sirenatrix)**\n\n> This transformative edu-series on Power - designed for Dom(mes), subs, and switches - who wish to gain a deeper understanding of influence and surrender. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned veteran, this workshop will enhance your skills and scenes - and perhaps even your perspective.\n\n> This series of workshops will likely change the way you view power exchange, giving you a new appreciation for the intimacy involved in influence. Raising your voice in a domineering way isn’t the same as influencing your sub with a single whisper—true power tends to be subtle, grounded, intentional, and deeply connected. In **POWER PLAY**, you’ll learn how to get someone’s entire mind, body, and soul on board with your desires. You’ll learn to play with resistance, use your physicality, and make your presence felt down to the core. Every session will delve into a different facet of power dynamics. Embrace your role, refine your tools, and discover the depths of power exchange in a supportive educational environment.\n\nResistance & Brat Taming\n------------------------\n\n*   **The Dance of Resistance**: Understand the dynamics of resistance and how to use it to heighten the tension and excitement in your scenes.\n*   **Taming the Brat**: Learn the art of brat taming, how to enjoy playful resistance, and transform it into a powerful exchange of energy.\n*   **Power Struggles**: When you feel a “Clash” between you and your counterpart, learn how to move the energy.\n\n((Come to all four workshops or drop in for just one! ))\n\n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Workshop Format:\n\n*   **Discussion and Practical Exercises**: The workshop will include a mix of discussions and hands-on exercises. You'll have the chance to interact with others, practice communication techniques, and receive feedback. \n*   **Solo and Group Work**: You can come alone or with a partner. During the exercises, you'll have the opportunity to switch partners, which allows for practicing with familiar partners and new acquaintances. This helps simulate both established dynamics and pickup play scenarios. \n*   **Dress Code and Interactions**: Feel free to dress however you want, whether vanilla or ready to play. Expect to interact with others for the exercises, at least in terms of communication and light D/s. More physical play will be saved for the jam afterwards. We do not pair people up, and encourage guests to make friends and engage to their level of comfort ensuring that all are able to learn and grow. Couples can stay paired the whole time or practice with others if you so choose.\n*   This workshop is open to all genders, sexual orientations, lifestyles, singles, and couples. All experience levels welcome. 18+.\n*   Refunds must be requested 7 days prior to the event. \n*   Doors open at 7:30pm and close at 7:40 pm. Please be on time and text ahead if you are delayed. \n*   You are welcome to wear a mask throughout the duration of the event.\n\n#### JAM After the Workshop:\n\nStick around for our jam session, exclusively open to workshop participants.

    "description": "Queer play never felt so good\n\n**About this event:**\n\nA kinky play party for the LGBTQIA2S+ community hosted by the Taillors femdoms and dommxs. This party is centering femme, enby, agender, gnc, genderqueer, genderf\\*cker, ace, two-spirit, intersex, and trans queers.\n\nThis is a 21+ event.\n\n**What is this event?**\n\nWe are a group of domme/xs, many of whom identify as queer, and we want to open up our dungeon space monthly to our LGBTQIA2S+ community to create a safe space to practice kink for us, by us. Come play saucy games, get to know other hotties, or even dare to approach one of our domme/xs for a mini-session!\n\n**Rough Schedule:**\n\n7:00pm: Introduction Circle and Consent Agreement (Safety rules!)\n\n7:15pm: Ice-breaker Game (Some of our favorites include human furniture musical chairs, “Who’s Spanking Me,” and Strap-On Swordfight - so bring those paddles and straps!)\n\n7:30-10pm: Free Play/Mingling!\n\n**\\*BYOB**. Bring some beverages or snacks to share! There is a fridge to keep your libations cool. Cups provided. FYI: While this is not a sober space, obvious intoxication will not be tolerated in play.\n\n**\\*Cis men** - you are not the focus of this party. We love you, we see you, but we are seeking to decenter you within this particular space, on this particular night. If you must be present, you must be a guest of one of our non-cis male guests, you must purchase our “Guest Pass,” and you must enter and exit with the person of whom you are a guest, and said person is also responsible for you and your behavior during your time within our space. Thank you for understanding and we will see you at our next party!\n\n**\\*Non-LGBTQIA2S+ (hetero) allies** - we are aiming to keep this party a queer space and we ask that you please come out to one of our other parties instead. We love you and appreciate your support, but the best way to support this event is to please allow us to cultivate a queer-only space this time. See you at our next party!\n\n**Rules:**\n\nThe Crown is a space for everyone to feel safe, welcome, and uplifted.\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy towards any kind of hate within our space. Ableism, racism, fatphobia, transphobia, homophobia, misogyny, and/or misogynoir will result in immediate expulsion. If you see this occurring or you are being bullied or harassed, please immediately report this to any of our Taillor’s domme/xs present and we will take care of the matter.\n\nConsent is mandatory for all activities. Please always ASK FIRST prior to touching, photographing, filming, or engaging in any type of play with another person or people, and please maintain ongoing enthusiastic consent during play. If someone is making you uncomfortable, violating your boundaries, or harassing you, please immediately report this to any of our Taillor’s domme/xs present and we will help you.\n\nStay safe and have fun!\n\n\\* If pricing of this party is a barrier to you, please reach out to us via text at 347-855-4877 for a discount code. Please do not take advantage - we have a limited number of these and would like to reserve them only for those who need them.\n\n**#TaillorCollective #ToEitherPleaseOrEducate**\n\n**Who are we?**\n\nThe Taillor Group is a collective of fierce femme-identifying Dommes headquartered in our beautiful residential dungeon in Bushwick. We are dedicated to the BDSM lifestyle and community, and offer a range of ways to be involved.\n\n**Where is The Crown located?**\n\nIn Prospect Lefferts Garden, Brooklyn. Walking distance from the train. Exact address on confirmation page, and ticket after purchasing.\n\n**DOOR TIMES:**\n\nDoors for the event will open precisely 5 minutes before starting time.\n\n**TICKETS:**\n\nQueer G eneral Admission: This ticket is for open-play (general admission) for those who identify as queer and are not cis-men.\n\nG uest Ticket: No straight people. Cis men must purchase the guest ticket and must be a guest of a non-cis male Queer General Admission (GA) ticket holder. Cis men must arrive and exit the party with their queer non-cis male friend who is the Queer GA ticket holder. Limit of one guest ticket per Queer GA ticket holder.\n\n**Dress Code:**\n\nAs much or as little coverage as you feel called to wear. Gender bending, fetishwear and expressiveness are encouraged. You may change your outfit on site.\n\n**GOOD TO KNOW:**\n\nThis event is 21+. The Taillor Collective plays SSC (safe, sane, and consensual).\n\nThe Crown is a space for everyone to feel safe and welcomed. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards any kind of hate within our space. Ableism, racism, fatphobia, transphobia, homophobia, misogyny, and/or misogynoir will result in immediate expulsion.\n\n**STILL HAVE QUESTIONS?**\n\nCall or text us at +1 (347) 855 4877, or send an email to events@taillors.com\n\n**NO REFUNDS**",

    "description": "Shanghai in the 1920s and 30s tantalized the British, American, French and Chinese alike with its lawless streets and dens of sumptuous iniquity. Known as \"the wickedest city in the world,\" artists, politicians, entrepreneurs, diplomats and the dispossessed roamed its winding streets, chasing thrills at every turn.\n\nStrains of jazz mingled with Hollywood film music and Chinese folk melodies in the night air, while this heady sonic melange drew the ire of burgeoning leftist and Nationalist movements, who denounced these hypnotic new sounds as \"opium for the masses.\" The so-called \"Paris of Asia\" even surpassed its European counterpart with the sheer volume of drugs, sex, sights and sounds offered to bold adventurers from far and wide.\n\nJoin us for a night of music extolling the danger, mystery and romance of this iconic era, featuring The Red Pavilion Jazz Band and aerial artistry from the Subtle Asian Polers.\n\n_Walk-ins welcome any time during the show. Doors 8:45pm, show 9:15pm_. _All events are 21+, and a valid physical ID is required for entry. Please be reminded that tables have a 2-drink minimum on Fridays and Saturdays, 1-drink minimum all other days. All sales are final._",

Come for the workshop and stay for the Jam to practice what you learned and meet other like-minded folks!_**\n\n**Are you ready to experience a divine merging of the er0tic and the spiritual?**\n\nStep into the world of _Shamanic Bondage_, where the ancient practices of Shibari and Kundalini energy awaken your Eros and bring you into alignment with the divine.\n\nJoin us at Pagan's Paradise for an immersive and transformative journey where submission becomes sacred and energy rises from your root to your crown. **This is** a chance to explore the deeper realms of er0tic energy and self-awareness, to release old blockages, and to connect with your own divine essence.\n\n**Event Highlights**\n\n**Beginner's Rope Safety & Chaos Rope Ritual:** Learn basic knots and frictions in a way that focuses on grounding and divine submission, rather than restraint.\n\n**Kundalini Activation & Chakra Alignment:** Awaken your Kundalini energy through breathwork and visualization, allowing your body’s energy to rise naturally and align with your highest self.\n\n**Essential Oils & Plant Medicine:** Experience the transformative power of scent through anointing with sacred oils that anchor energy and enhance your journey.\n\n**Soundscapes & Binaural Beats:** Guided by the soothing vibrations of low-frequency soundscapes, dive deep into the shamanic journey of self-discovery and energy awakening.\n\nThis session will leave you feeling grounded, empowered, and more deeply connected to both yourself and your partner. You’ll walk away with tools to continue this practice on your own and integrate its benefits into your daily life.\n\n**The Experience**\n\n**Preparation:** Upon arrival, you will enter a sacred space with low lighting, incense, and essential oils. We’ll start with an opening circle where each person can share their intentions for the evening.\n\n**Breathwork & Kundalini Activation:** The first part of the evening will be dedicated to breathwork, guiding you through deep inhalations and exhalations to flex the perineum and channel energy from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. You'll feel the subtle rise of energy within your body.\n\n**Rope Ritual:** You’ll then engage in a rope ritual that focuses on using basic knots and chaos rope techniques. The goal is to create a container for surrender and submission—not just to your partner but also to the divine energy that flows through you.\n\n**Shamanic Journey & Visualization:** This will be the heart of the experience. Through guided visualization, you will enter a meditative trance state supported by the healing properties of binaural beats and essential oils. You will feel your Kundalini energy spiral through your chakras, aligning and awakening your energy system.\n\n**Integration:** At the end of the session, you’ll have time to slowly reintegrate, untie, and reflect on your experience in a closing circle. This will be a time for sharing and grounding.\n\n**Ongoing Benefits:** After the session, you will take home tools to continue this practice and stay connected to the energy that was raised. You’ll learn how to maintain the alignment of your chakras and keep your Kundalini energy activated.\n\n**For the Adventurous Souls**\n\n*   This is not just an experience—it's a call to the soul. Come prepared to explore both the light and the shadow of your own energy, your body, and your connection to the divine.

    "description": "**Tantric Trance Dance 7:30pm-9:30pm**\n\n**_Address given in confirmation email additional info_**\n\n**Facilitated by** [Goddess Shakti](https://www.libglobal.org/)\n\n**Join us for an amazing evening of sacred spiritual energy!**\n\nEmbracing the Yoga of Sound and the essence of Hatha without doing typical asana poses that we have grown to believe in as an essential element of yoga.\n\nHatha (Ha-Tha, described as a “sun-Moon”)…. Nothing about poses.\n\nHatha is described as “sun-moon” to emphasize negative-positive, male-female, these two opposite forces in nature that we meditate upon to harness constructive forceful means to bring about change to our mental and emotional state.\n\nThis nourishing and playful practice encourages delicious trance, sensual body movement, and vocal Shakti invocation.\n\nIn this practice, we constructively and playfully rebel against convention. We approach yoga in an unconventional way with trance dance and using the power of our voice.\n\nRelish the experience of playfully cutting straight through the noise and chaos of various unpredictable mental states and life and take a break from the stubborn sticky impulses of ego in a trance-supported ecstatic dance practice.\n\nThrough this technique we experience the blissful absorption of yoga’s final stages: dhyana, yoga's 7th limb, and then finally, potentially the final 8th stage-Samadhi.\n\nThis is a specific progression of movement modes that promote delightfully deep meditation.\n\nThere are no complex or challenging poses or dance moves to work out. You do not need to think, figure things out, or worry how you look.\n\nYou are in a totally supportive space that has been infused with unconditional love. We will engage in a tonal voice technique that will help us to tune the divine instruments that we are and harmonize ourselves with the unified field of consciousness as we slide into a deep and peaceful meditative and free state.\n\n**The Workshop Experience:** This is an in-person workshop/gathering in a beautiful and private studio space in Manhattan (near Herald Square). The workshop will include 2.5 hours of mingling, getting to know your fellow humans, spiritual connections and movement.\n\n**Desired Benefits:** You will gain new ways to connect and bond with yourself and your fellow humans. You will be able to connect and explore your own relationship to this practice and all the yummy sensations possible. Opt in event meaning you only do what you feel comfortable with.\n\n*   Release the emotional baggage that accumulates in the body due to exposure to traumas in our life and causes us to suffer.\n*   Experience a practice of yoga that is incredibly liberating\n*   Re-set the nervous system and get a good physical work out for our bodies\n*   Induce in ourselves a state of excellent and bliss-filled meditation.\n*   Experience oneness (the goal of yoga)\n*   FEEL FREE & HAVE FUN\n\n**What to bring?**\n\n*   Wear fun or fancy dressy dancy clothes (or be liberated to opt for your natural state) for your enjoyment. If you opt to wear clothes, be sure that they allow free movement and sitting comfortably in meditation.\n*   Bring water or at least a water bottle\n*   Bring meditation cushion and/or yoga mat. (mats are available if you don't have)\n\n**Workshop Tickets:** Early Bird $30, Regular $40\n\n**NOTE:** We encourage everyone to have an open mind as this is a fun, open and explorative learning environment. We practice and review informed & ongoing consent practices with an emphasis on mutual opt in desire. This workshop is open to all gender identifications, sexual orientations, lifestyles, and we do not pair anyone as we honor genuine connections that arise in the evening.\n\nThis event is perfect and open for all experience levels.18+ for workshops. Refunds must be requested 24hrs prior to the event. Doors open at 7:30pm and closes at 7:45 pm please be on time.\n\nIf you have any more questions about this practice, email Goddess Shakti at [esotericyoga@protonmail.com](mailto:esotericyoga@protonmail.com)\n\nPagansParadise.com\n\nDaddyRetreat.com",

    "description": "This class will teach ties that incorporate a thin bamboo stick by tying it against the body. The ties are designed to introduce an additional element of restriction, when tying on the floor, utilizing the rigidness of the bamboo stick as opposed to the very pliable quality of rope.\n\nWe start the class by techniques to attach rope, body and bamboo together well, as this can be a challenge as bamboo is a slippery surface to tie on. Then specific ties, with themes like posture, exposure and torment, are taught. Detailing matters of placement of bamboo along the body, with body mechanics in mind, to achieve the desired effect.\n\nThis is a mixed level class suitable for students confident in fundamental tying techniques; You need to be able to tie single column tie well, without teacher support, and have prior experience in attending Shibari classes or workshops. It is not recommended as an introduction to shibari. Switching roles between ties is welcome if both partners are capable, but not mandatory.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $120 per tying pair\n\n_$40 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class_\n\nRSVP\n----\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. If you would like a refund, please email us at temple.nyc.bushwick@gmail.com , and we will take care of it with you. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice of cancellation._\n\n_Payment processing note: You will see a charge to “Porter Cycles” when paying for all our events!_\n\n#### **Bring**: \n\n*   4 ropes and 2 short pieces of about 4 meters each.\n*   It is highly recommended that the ropes are loosely layered jute, sold for the purpose of Shibari specifically, as the class content is designed for this type of rope.\n*   Bamboo sticks will be provided by Temple.\n\n#### **Tam’s Bio:**\n\nTamandua is a Swedish rigger based in Berlin, Germany. He has been working with rope professionally, primarily through teaching and offering intimate sessions to clients, since 2016.\n\nAlthough a rope top most of the time, he has broad experience as a rope bottom as well, and highly values ability to relate to both perspectives. He is a queer person, who appreciates tying with people of various gender. \n\n‘I consider kinbaku to be a complex erotic art, which is empathetically sadomasochistic at it’s core. Often tying in a way that can be challenging both for the one tying and the one in the ropes, my Shibari usually demands a lot of technical clarity when in the role of a teacher. At the same time, the student’s individuality is a priority when it comes to learning methods and intention. I view Kinbaku as a practice of continuous exploration – where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session, or over the course of a long partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time. For me, the essence of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional and sensual intention of the practice. And the more ones tying develop, the more seamlessly the parts can intermingle.’\n\nTamanduakinbaku.com",

Our main icebreaker game, HoS Guest Bingo, runs from 7:30pm until we have a winner: get to know everyone in the room, and win a drink if you complete your bingo card.\n\nMiss Scorpio is back hosting the mixer!

    "description": "Tamandua visits NYC with Chuck as his model, to share his personal approach to Kinbaku, using some of his commonly used ties and techniques. The class concept will focus a lot on the ability to manage the intensity of a tie with subtle adjustments and calm assertiveness. During the workshop Tamandua will show some ties that when executed correctly, allow the top to easily control how intense they are for the bottom. The idea is to develop more confidence to play, especially in the territory of Semenawa – tormenting rope. Guidance on how to tie and get tied more fluently, in a more natural feeling way, using body/rope management and communicative cues, will be a big part of the learning material for both tops/riggers and bottoms/models. Tamandua and his partner will explain how these factors play into the ‘soft skills’ of rope bondage, and into the power exchange principles of erotically tormenting rope.\n\nTechnically, each tie is introduced through getting familiar with the basic building blocks which it is made up of. By learning the technical details of the harnesses used, and exploring how they feel and function under load of suspension, and simpler applications. As the final exercise each day, this collected knowledge gets put to the test when we enjoy a longer and (for top and bottom) more challenging tie.\n\n#### Requirements:\n\n*   Both tops/riggers AND bottoms/models need to have prior experience with suspension, and with TK/gote.\n*   Riggers need to have learned how to make and lock suspension lines safely, and know these techniques by heart.\n*   Riggers also need to be able to tie a solid TK, even though Tamandua’s variation will be taught in class, as this is a very high risk profile type of tie to learn for suspension. Therefore the workshop should not be one of your first experiences with TK suspension.\n*   All these skills need to have been learned through an experienced instructor IRL (not video).\n*   Everyone attending should be familiar with how to recognise signs of nerve damage, nerve impingement, and how to actively check for it during a tying session.\n*   Please review your skills before purchasing tickets.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $400 per tying pair for the weekend.\n\n_$160 deposit, $240 cash at the start of class._\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. If you would like a refund, please email us at temple.nyc.bushwick@gmail.com , and we will take care of it with you. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice of cancellation._\n\n[RSVP](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=67806091)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n#### Tam’s Bio:\n\nTamandua is a Swedish rigger based in Berlin, Germany. He has been working with rope professionally, primarily through teaching and offering intimate sessions to clients, since 2016.\n\nAlthough a rope top most of the time, he has broad experience as a rope bottom as well, and highly values ability to relate to both perspectives. He is a queer person, who appreciates tying with people of various gender. \n\n‘I consider kinbaku to be a complex erotic art, which is empathetically sadomasochistic at it’s core. Often tying in a way that can be challenging both for the one tying and the one in the ropes, my Shibari usually demands a lot of technical clarity when in the role of a teacher. At the same time, the student’s individuality is a priority when it comes to learning methods and intention. I view Kinbaku as a practice of continuous exploration – where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session, or over the course of a long partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time. For me, the essence of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional and sensual intention of the practice. And the more ones tying develop, the more seamlessly the parts can intermingle.’",

    "description": "This evening is about suspension lines beyond their suitability to suspend. Rather, the focus will be on their ability to create tension, and the possibilities for play that open up when shifting to this point of view. Being able to handle a suspension line means more control over pressure, physical intensity and access to more postures for restraint as opposed to without. They are also greatly helpful for the rope top in order to manipulate and access the bottoms body without using as much strength.\n\nThe workshop is suitable for anyone with some type of prior education in suspension lines, including those who are not quite ready to suspend, but nonetheless want to familiarize themselves with using suspension points as a tool. For those already suspending this class can still be very beneficial in order to step back from routine and add more complexity to their tying sessions.\n\nWhile ties will be rather simple, basic techniques like attaching a suspension line to a harness, or locking off will not be taught. Therefore, it is not recommended that this is your very first introduction to suspension lines. Please make sure that you have received tuition in basic techniques prior to attending. Being able to tie a single column well is fundamental for all of the exercises. Ask someone experienced for feedback if unsure.\n\n4-5 jute ropes and 1 shorter rope will be needed.\n\n#### Tickets sold as pairs. $120 per tying pair for the weekend.\n\n_$40 deposit, $80 cash at the start of class._\n\n_CANCELLATION POLICY: you can reschedule once or ask for a refund up to 48 hours before the event. If you would like a refund, please email us at temple.nyc.bushwick@gmail.com , and we will take care of it with you. A processing fee of 5% will be subtracted from all refunds. No refunds will be issued with less than 48 hours notice of cancellation._\n\n[RSVP](https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=27853603&appointmentType=67806564)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### If the event is sold out, you can sign up for a [WAITLIST HERE](https://forms.gle/r4beaT43sK8jxua8A)\n\n#### **Tam’s Bio:**\n\nTamandua is a Swedish rigger based in Berlin, Germany. He has been working with rope professionally, primarily through teaching and offering intimate sessions to clients, since 2016.\n\nAlthough a rope top most of the time, he has broad experience as a rope bottom as well, and highly values ability to relate to both perspectives. He is a queer person, who appreciates tying with people of various gender. \n\n‘I consider kinbaku to be a complex erotic art, which is empathetically sadomasochistic at it’s core. Often tying in a way that can be challenging both for the one tying and the one in the  ropes, my Shibari usually demands a lot of technical clarity when in the role of a teacher. At the same time, the student’s individuality is a priority when it comes to learning methods and intention. I view Kinbaku as a practice of continuous exploration – where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session, or over the course of a long partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time. For me, the essence of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional and sensual intention of the practice. And the more ones tying develop, the more seamlessly the parts can intermingle.’",

This interactive workshop will be available both virtually and in-person (in Bushwick, BK).\n\nIn this workshop, we will:\n\n🦋 explore the roots of jealousy and its intersections with attachment theory\n\n🦋 discuss the concept of compersion and how secure attachment networks can nourish our sense of positive empathy\n\n🦋 engage in meditation & somatic practices to ground and integrate\n\nWe are also excited to welcome guest speaker Emily Martinez, founder of Evolved Love: Love Your Way, who will share insights on the nervous system and its connection to jealousy and attachment theory. This event will also include group discussion on the impact of identity and intersectionality on these topics, as well as how we can center the values of anti-racism, anti-capitalism and the dismantling of white supremacy through our relationship with ourselves, each other and society at large.\n\nEmily is a California Associate Marriage and Family Therapist (CA 132786) supervised by Dr. Kate Balestrieri (CA PsyD 26249 / NY RP 024670).",

An exploration of choosing the hard route.\n\n**“FLoOr tIeS ArE eAsY” A Class of Definitely Not easy Floor Ties - ADVANCED**\n\nWith complicated patterns and challenging positions, this class serves as a reminder to both tops and bottoms that you don't need uplines to make rope hard.\n\nThis class will explore two complex floor-based shapes--students will see each shape demonstrated in full and be given plenty of time to try out and play with the shapes themselves. This is an advanced rope class for both rigger and model, with the intention to challenge what we usually think of as \"difficult\" rope, by taking familiar structures and making them \\*more\\*.\n\n**About Your Instructor**\n\nIn March of 2018 Sydona found her way into the NYC kink scene and never looked back. Since then, she's immersed herself into honing her rope practice, perhaps obsessively. She currently works full time as a nightlife performer, bondage artist, photographer, and creator. In these past several years she's traveled both within the U.S. and internationally for rope opportunities, as a performer, as a student, and more recently as an educator. Previous to 2020, Syd trained and worked as a professional modern and contemporary dancer, and is proud of the way she melds her thirteen odd years of experience as a movement artist into her current practice.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions**\n\nFAQ: what should I bring?\n\nA basic floor rope kit--at least six bundles of rope and a cutting tool\n\nFAQ: what should I wear?\n\nWhatever you feel comfy and can move in! Anything from yoga clothes to undies.\n\nFAQ: any skill pre-requisites? (i.e., is this for beginners, advanced, everyone?)\n\nRigger prerequisites: any single and double column tie, basic frictions, some experience building complex structures and following multi-step patterns, confident in rope communication skills, knowledge of safety and risk in rope\n\nBottom prerequisites: confident in-rope communication skills, knowledge of safety and risk in rope\n\nPlease note that this is an advanced rope class, and anyone who does not meet these prerequisites will be asked to observe.\n\nFAQ: can I attend solo, or do I need to come with a partner?\\*This is a partnered class!\n\nFor BIPOC and SWorkers - use cope EQUITY at checkout for a discount.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**STAY IN TOUCH!**\n\nInstagram [@hitmeupnycity](http://www.hitmeupnyc.com/hitmeupnycity)\n\nJoin our [public newsletter](https://www.hitmeupnyc.com/newsletter)\n\n✨Volunteers: Limited volunteer spots available.

Scorca Hall for TOTALLY NORMAL: A Co-Dependent Trans Friendship Musical. Tabitha and Squid are broke stoner roommates who do everything together—like running the illegal, weed-fueled Hotbox Salon out of their apartment in Oakland, CA. Can their business survive Squid’s problem drinking, Tabitha’s risky hookup with their building’s super, and the everyday struggles of working class trans life? No spoilers, but it’s gonna get messy!\n\nIn this brand new show, trans people aren’t punchlines—they _deliver_ punchlines. Combining the spirit of groundbreaking queer musicals like _Falsettos_ and _Fun Home_ with the broad, raunchy humor of _Avenue Q_, TOTALLY NORMAL is a loving, hilarious tribute to the humor and humanity at the heart of trans friendships.\n\nTickets are pay what you can, with a suggested donation of $15.\n\n**Cast**\n\nTabitha: Blanca Del Loco\n\nSquid: Ellie van Amerongen\n\nBuffy/Lieutenant: Sushma Saha\n\nEarnest/Guncle: Dontalle Sylvester\n\nChad, Chorebitch1997, Director, Phantom Fairy: Sam Nackman\n\nTrent, Gretchen, Commander, Creep, Phantom Fairy: Sammy Overton\n\n**Creative team**\n\nDirector: Mika Kauffman\n\nMusic Director: Sid Quinsaat\n\nStage Manager: Hannahjo Anderson\n\nLyrics, Music + Book: Reina Bracha\n\nMusic: Matt Fukui Grandy\n\nBook: Kelly Anneken\n\nFor more info about the show, including more ways to get involved, visit [www.totallynormalmusical.com](https://www.totallynormalmusical.com/).",

    "description": "Hosted by [Nix (the Sirenatrix](https://www.instagram.com/the.sirenatrix)) & the Pagans Paradise Crew\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The theme of the November Sapphic Sirens party is Nocturnal Nymphs!!**\n\n> Step into the sacred realm of night, where the veil between the mortal world and the ancient spirits of the wild is thinnest. 🌙 Led by Nix (yes, of close relation to the goddess Nyx), our Nocturnal Nymphs gathering will enchant you with the dark desires of the midnight hour.\n\n> Wander through shadowy groves where the nighttime air hums with energy. Playful nymphs, mischevious fae, and other mystical sapphics will frolick in moonlight at this magical soiree.\n\n_NOTE: Anyone who is planning on engaging in scenes that may count as \"out of the ordinary\" must reach out with scene descriptions at least 72 hours in advance. This is so that our Guardians can plan risk management and community comfort precautions with you._\n\n(Any questions, more info/details and community guidelines please see [PagansParadise.com](https://pagansparadise.com/))\n\n> Welcome to a mesmerizing evening at Sapphic Sirens, where we celebrate the splendor of sapphic connections. This event is a haven for women, trans, and non-binary/GNC individuals to enjoy camaraderie, community, pleasure, and playful moments. Please put \\*some effort\\* into your outfit - bonus points if it's on theme! We’re committed to creating a safe(r) and welcoming space to facilitate new relationships, exploration, and fulfillment of desires! Good vibes only — or else! ;)\n\n### Who Can Attend\n\nSAPPHICS (21+). If you do not fit the below definition, please do not come. This is meant to be an intentional space for sapphics to meet other sapphics. For everyone else, there are other Pagans Paradise events that you’ll love. Obviously, enforcing this policy is tricky, but we will trust attendees to respect our space and our intentions.\n\n> (Definition from [LGBTQIA+ Wiki](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphic)) Sapphic, sometimes known as women loving women (WLW),or sapphist, refers to a woman or woman-aligned person of any sexual orientation who is attracted to women or woman aligned genders/gender identities. We mean to be specifically inclusive of non-binary people. It is an umbrella term for many identities, including those who are lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, or queer. It is used to promote solidarity among women and non-binary people of all identities who are attracted to those who are women and woman-aligned. It may also be used as an identity, and may be found particularly useful for individuals who know they are attracted to women but may be uncertain if they are attracted to other genders. It can also be used to describe a relationship between two women.\n\n**Ultimately, we reserve the right to remove anyone, sapphic or not, for any reason** - this is usually a last resort consequence of a breach of our Community Guidelines. Please respect this privileged space and treat it as your own home.\n\n### The Night will feature:\n\n*   Orientation: Nix, our host, will review guidelines about consent & mutual desire to ensure we’re all on the same page and will respect this privileged safe space. We’ll also explain the different rooms, play stations, and group activities throughout the night.\n*   Icebreakers: To facilitate new friendships and manifest fantasies, attendees will give a brief introduction including name, pronouns, and speak out loud any desires for the night. Note - this does not guarantee that your dreams will come true - and we discourage transactional Desperate D\\*ck/Predatory P\\*ssy energy! … but wishing out loud increases the chances of magic happening!\n*   Plenty of space to mingle around snacks, a low-stim room, and two play studios for two different vibes\n*   SAPPHIC Room: sensual & light, for massage, oils, etc.\n*   SIREN Room: kinky & dark, impact, rope, etc.\n*   Facilitators: We’ll have knowledgeable and approachable facilitators around to monitor safety and answer any questions.\n*   Limitations and Comfort: Everyone can engage according to their comfort level. There will be different rooms with different vibes, a hall to mingle in, and a low-stim chill room. Attendees can participate or just watch! Pagans Paradise is known for the welcoming, inclusive atmosphere that caters to newbies and scene veterans alike.\n\n### What to Bring:\n\n*   Dress to impress, bonus points if you dress on-theme\n*   BYOB / BYO-toys\n*   $$$ for vendors & performers (Thank you for supporting our community’s artists and entrepreneurs!)\n\n### **Ticket Prices**\n\n*   Early Bird $30\n*   Tier 1 $40\n*   Tier 2 $50\n*   At Door $60\n*   No refunds, if you cannot make it feel free to sell/donate ticket\n\n### **Schedule**\n\n*   7:30PM - 8:30PM: Mingling\n*   8:29PM: DOORS CLOSE (we mean it - please message in advance if this is an issue so we can expect you) \n*   8:30PM - Orientation, Icebreaker, and Performance(s)\n*   9:00PM - 1:00AM: Enjoy the various rooms of the space, each with different vibes.

    "description": "Enter your Squirting Superhero… Lola Jean holds the world record for Volume Squirted within 1 min by ejecting 1350 mL in under 25 seconds!\n\nSquirting is one of the most searched terms on spicy websites. Something bodies have done for centuries yet it has never been fully explained. Forget what you saw on porn or heard from “that guy” who claims he can make everyone squirt. The truth is: there is VERY little reliable research and science conducted on squirting. So who can we turn to in this time of need? Enter your Squirting Superhero… Lola Jean holds the world record for Volume Squirted within a one-minute period by ejecting 1350 mL out of her body in under 25 seconds.\n\nSo yeah.... you're gonna want to learn a thing or two from her. From the classic questions / greatest hits of - 'is it pee?' and 'can everyone do it?' to more complex questions of - why would someone want to squirt in the first place? is it better than an orgasm? and who is it really for?\n\nEveryone is welcome to this deep dive on squirting, anatomy, the benefits, realities as well as anecdotal experience....\n\nLola uses both her knowledge and collaborations with scientists, doctors, fellow educators, and most importantly - her own body. Lola has worked with countless individuals to understand their Squirting prowess. It is a matter of muscle group, not come hithers. That doesn’t mean everyone who attends this class will soak the bed by the end of the night. Squirting, much like sex, is a journey.\n\nExpect to walk away with:\n\n\\- Separating fact from fiction from folklore when it comes to squirting\n\n\\- Description of what the sensation can feel like as well as what is happening in the body during that time\n\n\\- Relationship between the muscles, glands, and organs in the body\n\n\\- The many, many ways one can experience this act by themselves\n\n\\- Why this overhyped act isn't the best thing since sliced bread and how to approach if it's something you'd like to experience\n\nThis is a lecture based class that includes live demo.\n\n**About the Instructor**\n\nLola Jean is a Sex Educator, Fetish Wrestler, headmistress of 7 Days of Domination, and World Record Holder for Volume Squirting (solo.) providing the No Frills Sex Education we both need and deserve in a variety of mediums. Lola brings a refreshing understanding to sex, sexuality, and kink to push individuals past what they think they are capable of.\n\n**FAQs**\n\nFAQ: what should I bring?\n\n\\*A notebook!\n\nFAQ: what should I wear?\n\n\\*Whatever you want!\n\nFAQ: any skill pre-requisites?

    "description": "Beyond Secretaries, Doctors & Teachers: Role-play that works for you. You don’t need to be a thespian or a former theater kid to explore!\n\nAre you the teacher’s pet or the class clown? Are you lovingly nursing your patient back to health or using and abusing their body in the name of science? Are you worried your roleplay will feel more like a high school production of Grease and less like that movie scene you think of when you pleasure yourself? When roleplay attempts fall flat, it’s usually because partners have spent more time picking out their costumes than negotiating the scene.\n\nSuccessful roleplay requires thinking through what motivates your character, how they want to feel, and what will help them get there. This seemingly kitschy kink can give you a space to explore parts of yourself that don’t get to come out IRL. As intimidating as whips and chains might be, there’s nothing quite like emotional vulnerability to activate that nervous system.\n\nJoin us on Thursday, November 14th for a workshop that will help you turn tired tropes into curated characters that support your kinky fantasies.\n\nYou’ll learn how to:\n\n\\- Discover what kind of character you want to play (and what you want your partner to play)\n\n\\- Negotiate a scene based on your boundaries, motivations, and desires.\n\n\\- Check-in with your partner without breaking character.\n\n\\- Minimize common pitfalls in roleplay explorations.\n\nYou don’t need to be a thespian or a former theater kid to explore your underlying motivations and uncharted desires. This workshop will support those of you interested in exploring this territory for the first time and those of you who want to shake-up the scenes you’re already creating.\n\n**About the Instructor**\n\nLola Jean is a sex educator, fetish wrestler, and world record holder for volume squirting. Follow her at @lolajeandotcom. Sarah is a pleasure-focused consent educator improving the way we approach sexual and interpersonal communication.

    "description": "Heart to Hearts is a space for cultivating community amongst folks who want to challenge what they’ve been taught about intimacy, sex, & relationships through themed discussions, activities, and resource sharing. \n\nOur Heart to Hearts on Sunday November 17th will be focused on Building Secure Attachment in Non-Monogamy.\n\n**Pain Point:** \n\nAttachment theory has become a popular and helpful way to describe how the relationships we had with our caretakers in childhood impact the way we show up to our intimate partnership as adults. Unfortunately, we tend to take it too far as a culture rooted in hyper-individualism. Public discourse about attachment styles often pathologizes them as fixed diagnoses rather than as a spectrum of responses we all have the potential to oscillate between based on many different factors such as our environments and habits. When we see attachment styles as an individual diagnosis, it can discourage us from doing the shared, day to day work it takes to create parameters for more securely attached connections. \n\n**Workshop Offering:**\n\nOur _Heart To Hearts: Building Secure Attachment in Non-monogamy_ workshop will unpack attachment theory as a spectrum of responses to relational environments, especially in relationship structures that are considered “alternative” like non-monogamy.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   Comprehensive and compassionate descriptions of each insecure attachment response\n*   Breaking the cultural binary of Avoidant/ Ambivalence VS. Anxious/Preoccupied\n*   A break down of the do’s and don’ts in building intimacy with each attachment style\n*   Attachment responses and the emotional body\n*   Options for relationship structures\n*   Creating mutual vulnerability and emotionally equitable partnership\n*   Building towards secure attachment in community\n\n**Schedule:**\n\nThis is an in-person event (Lower Manhattan/address shared with ticket purchase)\n\n4:00pm DOORS OPEN\n\n4:30pm Discussion\n\n5:05pm Open Sharing / group activities\n\n6:00pm CLOSE\n\nAlthough New York City has dungeons and sex parties, people who are new to open relationships, k!nk, queerness, or sex positivity might find sex explicit spaces intimidating, overwhelming, or just not accessible. Heart to Hearts is a G-rated space that centers radical ways of relating and challenges the dominant culture around sex and relationships.\n\nThis event is produced in collaboration with @heyplura and @HMUNYCity. Address will be provided once you purchase your ticket!",

While select feature performers may be Vanilla, our experiences, and shows are immersed in all kinds of subversive kinks if you want to see them. However, vanilla is a flavor, and those who identify as such can have an equally enjoyable experience. (Select BDSM events and play parties, due to their nature, are vetted and/or invite-only.)\n\n**SHADOWS OF INCLUSIVITY**\n\nThere are many areas of inclusivity any person or organization can choose to focus on. We are also keenly aware that due to trending or more socially acceptable forms of inclusivity and diversity, marginalized and oppressed people sometimes fall further into the shadows of inclusivity. Noting this, we also tend to cast and produce on the fringes and within the shadows often overlooked.\n\n**THE LIST** - Subscribe to the Siren Pack newsletter for first access to tickets and special enchantments: [http://bit.ly/SirenPackMailingList](http://bit.ly/SirenPackMailingList)\n\n**ABOUT SIREN PACK:** An immersive & subversive burlesque variety company producing provocative experiences.

Among others, her teachers were Naka Akira, Ren Yagami, Kinoko Hajime, Nicolas Yoroi. She also studied the Yukimura style. She has a background in aikido, tango, contact improvisation, femdom, tantra and other practices. She is currently studying to obtain a third higher education degree in psychology.\n\nTati is the organizer of international events in Ukraine and Poland and a regular contributor to Shibari Theatre in Asia and around the world. Tati is also a traveler. She currently lives in Thailand.\n\nOver the course of 12 years, Tati Limati has not just been training her rope skills, but researched many techniques and practices to integrate in her shibari practice. She combines elements of martial arts, contact improvisation, tantra, qi gong and Thai massage with the purpose of adding depth and sincerity to her own shibari work.\n\n In her teachings, she intends to help participants explore their underlying motivations and add deeper layers to their shibari play. With her techniques she aims to develop an understanding and the use of improvisation, making her students actively establish their own identities in rope play, instead of copying others without questioning.\n\n#### **About The Shibari Theater:**\n\nShibari Theater is a unique performance that immerses the audience in a profound world of emotions, feelings, and personal stories.

Check out the [FAQ on our website](https://tantrany.com/speed-dating/?aff=4ebfaq) (bottom of page)!\n\n### What is Tantra, and why \"Tantra\" Speed Date?\n\nForget those wild myths and blockbuster misunderstandings; Tantra is more about connection, fun, and being present than anything risqué. Imagine it as the art of \"relationship yoga,\" blending age-old practices with a twist of joy and mindfulness. Through exercises like breathing, meditating, and maybe even a little dancing, you'll find yourself more in tune with those around you. It's like a social superpower for making genuine connections, and trust us, it's a blast! After all, we find this level of presence is exactly what's missing from most dating encounters today. Why just talk when you can laugh, connect, and explore together?\n\n### What does this style of dating look like?\n\nPicture this: You'll form two fun-filled circles of fellow daters. The men make up the outer ring, and the women form the inner ring; so that you're paired off with a friendly face across from you. Together, you'll dive into engaging and heartfelt mini-dates (we call them 'dating stations') that last just long enough to spark a connection. After each experience, you'll bring your hands into a cheerful 'Namaste', share a quick thank you, and then — whoosh! — off to the next exciting meeting. Keep circling around, and by the end, you'll have met everyone.\n\n### What kinds of exercises will I do?\n\nNo clichéd icebreakers here! Our exercises are all about authentic human connection, not cheesy romance. We're talking engaging dialogue, light partner yoga, movement/dance, heartwarming eye-gazing, and even some gentle hand-holding. It's a delightful mix that goes beyond the mundane 'what's your job' chatter.\n\nThe coolest part? Every exercise is wrapped around a positive relating skill. So, not only will you have a blast, you'll be building real relationship skills too! And remember consent, you're the boss of how you participate. It's all about fun and connection in a way that feels good for you.\n\n### What if one of the exercises is not my cup of tea?\n\nThanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators do a fabulous job demonstrating what that looks like, so it feels good for everyone.\n\n### So how does this all add up to dating?\n\nGreat question! Think of it as a refreshing twist on the traditional dating scene. You'll get to interact, laugh, and connect with others, and then decide who you'd like to get to know better. We put a fun spin on things by letting the ladies take the lead in choosing; they'll place one of their beads in each man's pouch that they want to connect with. They'll get a feel for the guys' personalities and presence, while the men are guided on how to be grounded and open-hearted. Afterwards, either party can contact the other. It's all about letting connections unfold naturally.\n\n### What is the schedule?\n\n*   **Doors Open**: Right at the start time, we'll check you in, hand over your dating materials, and give you a playing card for a super fun Ice Breaker game. You've got until the stations begin to mix and mingle!\n*   **20 minutes in**: Time to let in folks from the waiting list, making sure everything's balanced and ready to roll.\n*   **30 minutes in**: Ice Breaker game wraps up, and the doors close. Now the real fun begins as we kick off the event. Be sure to check in before this time, or you'll miss out on all the excitement! (Running late or need to cancel? Check our policy below.)\n*   **End of the Night**: You'll feel the warm glow of connection and may not want it to end. While we'll gently nudge you toward the door, it's common for guests to join together for dinner, continuing the connections and conversations. Who knows? Your night might just be getting started!\n\n### What should I wear?\n\nThink comfort with a touch of your best self! You'll be sitting and also moving, so choose an outfit that lets you feel relaxed but still sharp. Just remember, it's a date, so grooming matters. And go easy on strong scents; some people are sensitive.\n\n### Is there food or drink at the event?\n\nWe usually don't serve food or drinks (unless it's a special event), so feel free to bring a water bottle. Snacks might be good for before or after, but check with the venue, as some don't allow food. As tempting as a quick bite during the event might be, you'll want all your attention on your dates. And remember, alcohol is a no-go, so please arrive with a clear and ready mind.\n\n### How many dates will I have?\n\nGet ready for a lively evening with up to 20 opportunities to connect! Our events typically max out at around 40 singles. Assuming a balanced mix, you'll have the chance to spark a connection with up to 20 different people. And, we're all about quality not quantity. You'll find each moment meaningful as you dive into engaging exchanges with others who, just like you, are looking to explore connection and authenticity.\n\n### What is the gender balance at the event?\n\nWe don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)\n\n### What if I don't match with anyone?\n\nAs many of our attendees say, \"I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!\" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.09% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!\n\n### What is the age range?\n\nSome events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. Whether you're a little outside the range or just curious about meeting people within it, you're welcome here.\n\nOur most popular events are open to all ages, drawing a vibrant and diverse crowd. Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. And while age might be a curiosity, what truly sets our events apart is the connection experience.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date® unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!\n\n### Will there be enough people?\n\nDon't let low RSVPs in one spot fool you. Our events often sell out faster than you can say \"Namaste,\" and often with a waiting list. We're keen to promote across various platforms, and they don't all show the same love. Rest assured, we make sure there's always a crowd worth your while. So come on down; your next amazing connection could be just one RSVP away!\n\n### Do I have to be single to attend?\n\nAh, the modern relationship landscape—a tapestry of statuses! While you don't need to be 'single' in the traditional sense, you do need to be in a space where romantic connections are possible. If you're already committed and not open to new love, you may want to consider our couples events. But if you find your heart's door ajar, even just a smidge—or if you're teetering on the edge of 'ready to date'—this could be the perfect space to explore what's possible. Consider this your invitation to a playground of connection, perfect for testing the waters!\n\n### Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?\n\nDiversity is the spice of life, and we're cooking up all kinds of flavors! This classic version of Tantra Speed Date® is primarily designed for men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In this setup you'll find yourself in one of two gendered circles—one for men and one for women. You'll rotate through up to 20 dates with members of the opposite gender. But don't fret, fabulous queer friends! We also host Queer Tantra Speed Date events in select cities. So if you're looking for a rainbow connection, keep an eye on our website to see when we're bringing that magic to a city near you!\n\n### What is your cancellation/refund policy?\n\nWe get it—life's a whirlwind! If you find yourself having to back out, no worries. Here's the lowdown: cancel 24 hours or more ahead and you'll get a refund or transfer, no fuss. If you're within that 24-hour window, or fashionably late and miss the opening ceremony, shoot us an email and we'll graciously \"speed date\" your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy. So keep your plans as flexible as a yoga pose, and communicate with us before the event kicks off. No refunds or transfers after the chimes ring and the magic starts!\n\n### Can I sign up with my friend?\n\nAbsolutely! We often have Bring-A-Friend ticket discounts! So thanks for sharing Tantra Speed Date® with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.\n\n### More Questions?\n\nContact us at **help@tantrany.com** we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.",

When Tier 1 sells out then Tier 2 is what's available.. and so on.\n\n**QUESTIONS:**\n\n**email:** [contact@shivaj.com](mailto:contact@ShivaJ.com)\n\n**COMMUNITY SUPPORT:** If you can comfortably afford to purchase your ticket at a higher tier....we encourage you to do so as that will make a lower tiered ticket available for someone in the community who may be in need of it due to their financial status. Thank you so much for kindly considering this\n\n**SOLO MALES**: This is a gender-balanced event and solo males must purchase a \"Solo Male\" ticket. The first couple of solo males will be \"confirmed automatically\"... after that, if registering alone, you will be placed on a waiting list. Your space in the event will be confirmed as soon as a matching solo female registers. If you are unable to be confirmed, your money will be fully refunded electronically the day after the event. Of course, another option is for you to find someone to register with as a pair.\n\n**A NOTE ABOUT GENITAL CONTACT:** There is no direct \"Manual-Genital Massage\" in this workshop... that is the specialization taught in a different course. However there is some \"Genital Brushing\"... where a part of the giver's body (for example, a forearm or a thigh) may brush with light to moderate pressure across the genitals of the receiver. This happens at very specific points in the massage sequence to activate & circulate the receivers sexual energy throughout \"their own body\". As with \"any\" exercise in this workshop, this is totally optional (as stated above) and if you desire not to experience this, the technique can be easily modified to fit your individual boundaries.\n\n**\\*ALL SOLO PARTICIPANTS (Female & Male):** This class is \"gender-balanced\" and usually filled with about 50-60% \"SOLO\" male & female participants.\n\n**ALL SOLO PARTICIPANTS** will be pairing up with a different solo participant of the opposite gender for each morning and afternoon session (3-4 hours in length) throughout the workshop. This is particularly helpful for learning the correct dynamics for effectively applying the techniques on different people (for example certain techniques need to be adjusted to be applied on a tall person as opposed to a shorter person etc.).\n\n**NOTE:** For the workshop to run smoothly, if you begin the workshop as a \"Solo\" participant (male or female) you will need to remain in that status throughout the duration of the workshop and change to a new practice partner of the opposite gender at every rotation point (every 3-4 hours).\n\n**IMPORTANT:** if you desire to work with a same gender partner you will need to attend as a pair. We truly wish it weren't the case, but unfortunately after many tries, it has turned out be too logistically complicated to accomplish within the rotating group of solo participants 🙏💗\n\n**SAME SEX COUPLES** are warmly invited to attend as a pair.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n*   This is a \"heart centered....touch positive....super-fun\"... and information-rich workshop.\n*   All personal boundaries will be Lovingly respected!\n*   All exercises are optional or \"negotiable\".\n*   You are welcome to wear a Covid mask if you wish.\n*   Open to SINGLES & COUPLES.\n*   COUPLES may do all exercises together if they wish.\n*   SAME SEX COUPLES are welcome to attend as a pair.\n\n**MORE DETAILS:**\n\n*   **CLOTHING:** Please dress so as to have as much skin exposed as possible (Women could wear thong bottom & bikini top & Men could wear a thong, briefs or boxers... nudity is also very acceptable and in fact encouraged.\n*   **PLEASE BRING:** (1) a sheet (2) a large towel & small hand towel (3) Massage oil (coconut oil?) preferably in a spill-proof dispenser! (4) Wet-Wipes (5) A bag lunch each day. Note that there will not be enough time to \"go out\" for lunch and we invite you to bring something to share with the group to help foster connection and community during our two days together.\n*   **MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:** I am confident that you will receive valuable skills, have plenty of Fun and feel enriched by this highly detailed journey....OR... your $$ back (minus any 3rd party processing fees... Must be requested within a week of the workshop completion). Seriously......I am absolutely committed to everyone's happiness, personal growth & satisfaction!\n*   **CANCELLATION POLICY:** 7 days notice required for a full refund (minus any 3rd party processing fees). After that point, I am happy to offer 50% of your registration as credit towards any of my future events.\n*   **BOUNDARIES:** We will create a \"safe space\" where everyone’s individual boundaries will be lovingly respected...…and all exercises are by personal choice only! This event is carefully designed so that attendees can choose to participate at the level that feels comfortable to them in each moment..…. and…..the conditions will be created for each person to play with and expand their boundaries at their own pace. You are invited to be in control of your own journey.\n\n### **MORE INFO can be found at:**\n\n[https://shivaj.com/tantricmassagemasterclass/](https://shivaj.com/tantricmassagemasterclass/)\n\n**ABOUT YOUR FACILITATOR:**\n\n**~ Shiva J** is a Certified Tantra Educator, Kundalini Yoga Instructor, Somatic Bodyworker, Certified Life Coach, Licensed Clinical Hypnotherapist, and Master NLP Practitioner who has been in the world of transformational work since 2003.\n\nWith a 20+ year career in the fitness world under his belt he suddenly found himself with a severe back injury that prevented him from continuing on that path. Around the same time he found himself facing divorce, bankruptcy and homelessness. Determined to rise from these pitfalls he began to study holistic wellness, and Tantra to help heal his body, mind and spirit. Having prevailed over a rather bleak and almost hopeless dark night of the soul he experienced a spiritual awakening and discovered his true calling as a healer, and community builder.\n\nWith his unique perspective of the mind, body, spirit connection he has helped thousands of clients transform their lives. He combines all of these unique tools along with his gift of insight to help his clients overcome any physical or mental challenge they may be currently experiencing in their lives.\n\nWhen not at work doing what he loves, Shiva J can be found at a local internet cafe sipping a dirty chai latte, attending ecstatic dancing, a drum circle, or out hiking or biking local trails and if you can't find him at all, he has probably taken a sabbatical and gone hiking or camping someplace more exotic!\n\n**Shiva J is available for private sessions, workshops and retreats.**\n\n[www.ShivaJ.com](http://www.shivaj.com)\n\n[www.TheSacredKings.com](http://www.thesacredkings.com)\n\n[www.TheHeartCenteredBeing.com](https://www.TheHeartCenteredBeing.com)\n\n**Facilitator** [Tantra Speed Date® San Diego](https://www.tantrany.com/tantra-speed-date/?region=sd&aff=7jj)\n\n**TESTIMONIALS:**\n\n_\"Embarking on this journey into the art of T@ntric/Sensu@l Massage was nothing short of magical!
